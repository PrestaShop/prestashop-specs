## Contributing to PrestaShop-specs

PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements to the specifications.

**This repository is dedicated to the specifications of the PrestaShop project.** 

To contribute to the source code, see the [PrestaShop repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop).


## Type of contributions

There are 3 types of possible contributions.


### Improving existing specs

If when reading some specification you see some improvements to be made, feel free to propose them.
These improvements should imapct only the way the specifications is written and not the specifications and behaviors themselves.
Examples: Fixing typos, improving the syntax, add visuals, add more details, etc.



### Adding missing specs

We add and complete the specifications progressively, thus some features specifications are missing for the moment.
You can add the specifications to these existing features.
These specs should define the current behaviors in the latest Stable version.
To do so you can follow the structure used on the template at the end of the end of this page, and see some examples in the repository or in the [templates folder](/spec-templates).


### Adding specs for new features

Everytime we decide to build a new feature, the specifications must be written to guide the developers through the feature's development.



## Process to follow

Contributors should follow the following process:


### If you feel comfortable working with Git and forking the project

2. Fork the PrestaShop project to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch. Be sure to follow the coding standards.
6. Push your changed branch to your fork in your GitHub account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes on the PrestaShop project. If you need help to make a pull request, read the Github help page about creating pull requests.
8. Wait for one of the product manager either to include your change in the codebase, or to comment on possible improvements you should make to your content.


### If you don't feel comfortable forking the project or using Git, you can also either

**Edit a file directly within GitHub:**

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Browse to the target file
3. Click the "Edit" button, make your changes in the editor then click on "Propose File Change". Github will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own Github account, then suggest to create a pull request to PrestaShop.
4. Once the pull request is submitted, you just have to wait for a product manager to answer you.


**Submit an issue using GitHub:**

This is a ticket-tracker for PrestaShop-specs, and the best place to write a suggestion or request an improvement. You will need to create an account on GitHub.
