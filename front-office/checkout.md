## Shipping method step

If the merchant has enabled the 'Offer recycled packaging' option in the Shop Parameters > Order Settings section of the back office, a checkbox should be displayed in the _Shipping Method_ block of the checkout: `I would like to receive my order in recycled packaging.` in `Shop.Theme.Checkout`. If checked, this information must be added to the final summary, the order confirmation, and the 'order_conf' and 'new_order' emails.


## Payment step

If the store has only one payment method available, this payment method should be selected by default.


## Final summary


If the merchant has enabled the 'Final summary' in the Shop Parameters > Order Settings section of the back office, a panel summarizing the order is displayed below the paiment block.
It displays the address of shipping and invoice, the shipping method ,and the product list of the cart.

it only displays the address of the invoice and the product list of the cart. 

If the merchant has enabled the 'Final summary' and 'Offer recycled packaging' options in the Shop Parameters > Order Settings section of the back office, and if the customer has decided to receive his/her order in recycled packaging, it should be mentioned in the _Shipping Method_ block of the final summary: `Recycled packaging` (localized in `Shop.Theme.Checkout`).

## Order confirmation
