**Specifications for the order view page for 1.7.7 - 2019**

# **User Story:**

# As a merchant, I need to be able to manage all my orders processed on my website.

As a merchant, managing my orders is essential for my e-commerce, so I need to be able to:

5. **Summary of the standard refund, partial refund and return product feature**

## **Merchandise return has to be enabled if the merchant want to use the standard refund, partial refund and return product feature**

| **Button** | **Why** | **What is does** | **When is it displayed** | **When is it hidden** | **Option** | **Summarise Behaviours** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**Cancel products**](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16650) | To Cancel a wrong order | It deletes the products (or reduce the quantity). It also changes the order status to **Canceled** when all the products are canceled. | At the creation of an order and merchandise return is **enabled** | When the order is considered as paid |   | Select the products to cancel then their quantity. Press on the cancel products to confirm. |
| [**Standard refund**](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16653) | To refund products, before it is sent to the customer (the products are still in the stock) | Refund by voucher or by credit slip of the total amount of products | When the order is considered as **paid** or **at least one payment** is linked to the order and Merchandise return is **enabled** | When the order is considered as shipped | - Generate a credit slip- Generate voucher- Repay shipping costs (option appears if you select to generate a voucher or a credit slip) | Select the products to refund and their quantity. Then select the refund option. Press on refund products to confirm. |
| [**Partial Refund**](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/15820) | To refund any amount of products and/or the shipping cost | Refund by voucher and restock | When the order is considered as **paid** or **at least one payment** is linked to the order | Never | - Restock products- Generate a voucher | Select the quantity and amount of the refund per product, the amount of the refund for shipping cost.

Then select the refund option. Press on refund products to confirm. |

If this order has been partially paid by voucher. The merchant can refund either by selecting the total amount of the selected products or this total minus the amount of the vouchers.

Before 1.7.7, it used to have an input to select the specific amount for the voucher. The objective of the field was to customize the voucher value but it was only displayed when a voucher was applied on the order. So to customize a voucher on return product or standard refund, the order has to have a voucher applied in the order.
To harmonize the behaviors, we put the specific custom edition into the partial refund button and set return product button with straightforward options. The merchant can customize the voucher on the partial refund feature.

6.  **Partial refund button**

If the current or new order status of order considered **as paid** then **the button is shown.** After clicking on the button, then the product table will take the full width of the page. The user can edit the refund amount by product and also the shipping cost. He must select the quantity of the product concerned for the refund and then enter a seleced refund amount per product line. The maximum refundable amount is written bellow all the amount input in tax included.

By default, the entered quantity has 0 pre-filled. To release a partial refund, the user must have selected a minimum quantity of 1. The maximum refund is determined by the product totals. The limitation of the refund does not take into account the amount paid whether it is partially or totally paid by the customer.

**Before the validating a partial refund,** the user can choose to re-stock or generate a voucher by checking the checkboxes.

[Partial Refund screen](https://invis.io/YKTGGFZAMCB#/385922519__Order_Details_-_Partial_Refund)

**After the validation a partial refund,** a new column is added with quantity previously selected and the amount entered.

When the status "Refunded" is applied to the order, the refund amount is deducted to the total spent by the customer since registration and the number of valid orders placed decreases by 1.

7. **Cancel products button**

The cancel button is only displayed by default on the creation of an order.
The button **is hidden** when the order is **considered as paid**

When pressing the button, the product list takes the full with of the page and the column cancel is added.

The customer panel displayed on the left of the product list has **the customer’s title, name, last name, and customer reference.** To see the full customer description, you can click on **View full details** that redirect to his customer page on another page.

Customer panel is divided into 3 parts:

-   Customer card regrouping the customer’s information
-   Shipping and Invoice address
-   Private customer note

**Customer card** displays :

-   **the email on a “mailto” link**
-   **date of the account registered**
-   **valid orders placed on a black background**
-   **total spend since registration on a black background.**

1. **Deleted customer**

When a customer is deleted:

The customer information such as **the email, the date of the account registered, the valid orders placed, the total spend since registration**, shipping and invoice address drop-down button and the private note block are not displayed.

The customer name is changed to **"Deteled customer"**. It removes the icon account box and the link to redirect to the full details customer page.

2. **Guest customer**

If the customer is a guest:
The fields "account registered" and "total spent" are hidden.
Below the customer name, "Guest" in grey (Open sans semibold 14px #6C868E) is displayed.

The button to transform a guest inoto a customer is removed. The feature is still available on the customer page. The order is not the place to handle customer management. It was removed to not encourage the merchant to transform Guest to a Customer account by letting a button on the order page.

3. **Shipping and Invoice address**

Each address has **a button** to update or change it. The button opens a list to select to edit or update it.
Editing an address actually creates a new address and soft-deletes the old one. So, if the edited address is used by an old order, it will not be updated with the new address.

[Edit/Change adresse behaviors](https://invis.io/YKTGGFZAMCB#/386397109_Edit_Adress)

**The edit address redirects to the edit address page of the selected address**. After saving any edit of the fields of the address form, **the user is redirected on the order** that he was editing in the first place.

And **change address** opens the popin that allows the user to choose the new address form a droplist.

Selecting the message prefills **the message input text**. By default, there is no prefilled message so the droplist shows “-”. below the droplist, the link named **"configure predefined messages"** is available. It redirects to**the order messages page** to access to the predefined messages.

After selecting the droplist selection, the prefilled text is still editable.

The maximum of character in the text input is 1200 char. If the merchant manages to send a message of more than 1200 characters, the message is not sent and the warning message "This field cannot be longer than 1200 characters" is displayed below the text input.


## IV. **Products panel**

1. **The Product list**

Below the actions button and on the right of customer panel, the product panel displays **the order’s products into the table list** showing:

-   **the product’s image,**
-   **product name (with its name, combination name and reference),**
-   **stock location,** if one of the products has one
-   **base price with tax included,**
-   **quantity,**
-   **available quantity,**
-   **total with tax included,**
-   **and 2 action buttons : edit and delete.**

**When the product has customization**, a row is added below the product with the labels of the customization and the content from the customer (image or text). When the number of images exceeds the size of the toe, they go to the next line.

[popin displaying the products from the pack](/img/customization.png)

**When the product is a pack of products**, a link is added below the product name to show all the products in a popin.

[Link in the product row](/img/view-pack-content.png)

By pressing on the link "View pack content", it shows all the products from the pack in a popin:

[Popin displaying the products from the pack](/img/pack-content.png)

**The pagination of the list starts when there are more than 8 products**
**The stock location column is hidden** only when none of the products has a stock location. The column is only displayed at the corresponding pagination. If only a product on page 2 of the list has a stock location then the stock location column appears on page 2 and hidden in the other pages.

[Pagination design](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/YKTGGFZAMCB#/screens/392128609)

**The quantity** is colored in a dark grey background if there are at least 2 quantities.

**Possible actions:**

In an existing order (until it gets the order status “Processing in progress”), it is possible to perform actions on the order’s products and discounts. Merchants can :
- add new products to the order
- remove products from the order
- modify elements of existing products
- add new cart rules to the order

Below the totals, a warning message is displayed to warn the user that **for this customer group, prices are displayed as HT** or **for this customer group, prices are displayed as TTC** depending on the customer group setting and also **that returns are disabled.** when the merchandise return is disabled on the merchandise returns page.

2. **Add new products** 

When clicking on Add a product, it adds a row on the table list with a search bar on the product name column. The merchant can search for any available product. If the desired product has combinations, a drop list appears below the search bar. After selecting the product, the user can edit if needed :
- the base price tax excluded or tax included. When modifying one field, it automatically modifies the second field according to the product tax.
- the quantity
The quantity input is an input type number that decreases the stock left when the user increases the quantity. If the quantity selected is higher than the stock, the available quantity label becomes red. The product is added in the product table and to the order after **pressing on the add button**: if the quantity is greater than 0; if the quantity is less than or equal to the quantity available. Otherwise, a warning error is shown (except if the stock parameter allows selling without stocks (in Product quantities tab). In this situation, the merchant can add as many product items as he wants).

When I add a product already present in the order from the back office, the addition is blocked by displaying the following error message (EM): "This product is already in your order, please edit the quantity instead."

When I have multi invoice and I add the product to an invoice that already contains the product, the addition is blocked by displaying the following error message "This product is already in the invoice #number, please edit the quantity instead." localized in Admin.Notifications.Error

**Specific scenario**: When the merchant wants to add more quantities of the same product, he has to edit the product quantity to add some items.

-   **Product minimum quantity**

The minimum quantity of a product is determined by all the products of the order regardless of whether the products are separated between invoices. It allows a merchant to add a product on another invoice because the minimum quantity is respected in the order.
Editing the quantity of the product to a quantity less than the minimum quantity required is authorised, the responsibility belongs to the merchant.

For example, when I add a product A with a minimum quantity, if the quantity of the new product A and the current quantity are equal to or greater than the product is added. Otherwise, an error is launched: "Error! Minimum quantity of X must be added", X quantity missing to be equal to the required minimum quantity.

A product allowed to be ordered out of stock can be added to an order without complying with the minimum quantity rule.

-   **Product associated to cart rule**

When I add a product associated with a discount to an order, the discount is also added. 

- In the case of a discount on the total of the order, if I add a second time this product, the discount should not be added and avoid the accumulation of discount. 

- In the case of reduction to a specific product of a fixed amount, the discount is applied only once despite the number of quantities of the same product in the cart and the total per user strictly greater than 1.

If the discount is updated the order remains the same.

-   **Cart rule behaviors**

**Specific scenario**: Adding a product recalculates all discounts and the total price. So if the merchant has a discount linked to a specific product for example at 40%. Then he changes the discount to 50% discount. Finally, he add a new product, the discount will update and 50% discount will be applied to the order.

**Specific scenarios**: A product added in an order with a discount attached to it is added in the order as well. 

In the case of a discount to a specific product by percentage, the discount applies to the total amount of the product taking into account the quantity, i.e. the discount = quantity of the product * %. But only applies once in the basket even if the merchant can still use the discount on other carts (total user for each user > 0).

-   **Multi invoices behaviors**

When I add a product when a invoice is already generated, the merchant can choose to: 
- Offer free shipping for this product or apply the shipping cost
- Associate the product to an existing or new invoice

When the order has several invoices, it is possible to add an already existing product in the order if they are related to a different invoice.
There is only one possible price per product even if they are from different invoices. Therefore, if a product is added with a different price in another invoice, the price will be updated on the first invoice. To avoid confusion, a pop-up window will be displayed before the addition to confirm that the action may have an impact on the other order.

3. **Remove products from the order**

Deleting one or several products is very easy : a remove icon is available to remove one or several quantities of a paid product. Current bug : if I delete the paid product, it will also delete the gifted product (the voucher is still displayed). The deletion should only delete the paid product.

**Specific scenarios** : when a product in the cart is a gift product (from a cart rule)
Note that it is not possible to delete a gift product from the cart, it’s only possible by removing the associated cart rule.

Furthermore, If the merchant has a paid product, and the same product, but gifted, in the cart, he should not have a Remove button available on the product line. The remove button only appears when there are no longer gift products on the same product line.

**A confirmation pop-up appears after clicking on the Delete button.**

4. **Edit products already in the order**

When clicking on the edit button of a product line, the user is allowed to edit :
- The product base price tax excluded or tax included. When modifying one field, it automatically modifies the second field according to the product tax. ex : If the user edits an amount in the input without tax it will insert the amount plus the product taxes in the input with tax automatically. And vice versa, if the user edits an amount in the input with tax it will insert the amount less the product taxes in the input without tax.
- The quantity of the product. Behaviours are the same as when merchants add new products. Increasing or decreasing will update the stock available quantity.

The merchant is warned if he edits the price of the product with a specific price or a catalog price rule.
![Warning on the edition of a product with specific price](/img/Warning_on_the_edition_product_specific_price_catalog.PNG)

**While editing the quantity, the total price will be updated multiplying quantity with the base price.**
The **Update button** saves the modification and **Cancel button** drops them.

These rules apply for all types of products, with or without combinations. Nevertheless, there are some specific cases, detailed below :
- If the product has a specific price. In this situation, if applicable, then when adding this product to the order (or adding quantity of the same product), the base price will be automatically recalculated to include the discount. If the conditions are not met (ex: expired date, only for a specific customer, etc.), then the normal price should be applied.

- If the product has a Minimum quantity for sale higher than 1, defined in the Product quantity tab. In this situation, when trying to add a product with less than the minimum quantity, an error will be displayed with the required minimum quantity. Then, by editing this quantity, the merchant can enter any quantity, the verification is done only when adding. 

- If the product has additional shipping fees associated with it, then the fees are added to the final shipping fees of the order.

- If a cart rule is associated with a product :

    1/ If the cart rule specifically applies a reduction on a product, it uses the rule defined for when the product is added in the order.
    2/ If the cart rule adds a free gift to the order

5. **Cart rule list**

The below the product panel, there is the order's summary:

-   **Products total with taxes excluded**
-   **Total shipping**
-   **Discount** if there is any cart rule applied 
-   **Wrapping** if there is wrapping option in the order
-   **Taxes**
-   **Total** in black background

Condition of cart rule:
-	temporal discount does not affe

6. **Add a new cart rule**

-   **Add a new discount**: opens a popin to create your new cart rule between the percentage, the amount (taxes included) and Free shipping type. The value must be a percent or amount value greater than 0. The percent value cannot exceed 100 and the discount value cannot exceed the total price of this order.

[Popin add discount](https://invis.io/YKTGGFZAMCB#/381874231__Order_Details_-_Add_Discount)

The vouchers will be added on the table list displaying the discount name, value and the delete button on the top of the summary order. The new discount created is added with the status deactivated on the cart rule page with zero quantity.

**If the order status is considered as paid**, either on adding a product or adding a discount adding, the user has to specify on **which generated invoices will be applied.**

7. **Invoice generation**

**Specific snenarios**:
When a new invoice is created with free shipping, a discount is generated at the value of the shipping cost with the name:"[gGenerated] CartRule for Free Shipping".
On the invoice, the discount is not diplayed. It only displays the free shipping in Shipping Costs.
