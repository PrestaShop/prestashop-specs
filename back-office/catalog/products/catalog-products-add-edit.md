# SPECS PRODUCT PAGE

As a merchant I need to be able to correctly create, edit and delete my products.

## WHY

The add / edit product page \(Catalog &gt; Products\) has already been migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.0 version, but many behaviours are not specified which have introduced regressions and bugs. We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test and avoid any new bugs.

Furthermore, we have identified different issues related to this page that we should fix during the re-migration : [https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891)

## WHAT

Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with when creating / editing a product for his/her customers.

## SPECIFICATIONS

[The first step is to detail the behavior of each field per tab when creating / editing a product.](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/back-office/catalog/catalog-products-add-edit.md#product-creation-edition)

[The second step of this document is to detail the type of each fields and error messages per tab.](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/back-office/catalog/catalog-products-add-edit.md#errors)

[The third step is to detail the multistore behavior.](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/back-office/catalog/catalog-products-add-edit.md#multistore)

## 1.    Product creation / edition on Back office <a id="product-creation-edition"></a>

If I filled something in a tab and I try to click on another tab, a silent autosave is done:
When we detect a click on another tab, we trigger the save. If it works, we open the new tab and display a success message "Settings successfully saved". If it fails, we display a warning message to user: "Settings cannot be saved"
\([issue 18461](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18461)\)  

If I filled something in a tab and I change the product type (from example from virtual to standard), then what I had filled in the tab (example virtual product tab) is kept for the fields which are displayed again in the equivalent tab (for example quantity for a standard product)

### Elements in all tabs \[[EPIC](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14770)\]

**As a merchant I want to always see some elements when I create or edit a product.**

Some elements are displayed in all tabs. Here is the list of those elements 

* **Product name**: When you create a new product, this field is empty and there is a placeholder: “Enter your product name”.<br/> 
Only the name in the employee language must be filled. If the name of the product is not indicated for the other languages, after saving the name of the product in the employee's language is retrieved and displayed for all the other languages. <br/>
A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed \(disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down\). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed.      
Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic.
* **Product type**: Drop-down with 3 : Standard product, Pack of products, Virtual product.       
Please note, when editing a standard product with combinations, you can’t change the type, the drop-down is disabled.
* **Sales**: This link redirect to Stats &gt; product detail and is open in a new browser tab
* **Product list**: Link that displays the list of all products filtered as in the catalog, with their id, name, price, quantity.       
If you click on the id or the name, you arrive on the product page in basic settings tab.       
If you click on the price, you arrive on the product page in pricing tab.       
If you click on the quantity, you arrive on the product page in the second tab which is: Quantities for a standard product without combinations or a pack, Combinations for a standard product with combination, Virtual product for a virtual product.       
When the quantity is equal or less than 0 the quantity is displayed with a red background.
* **Help**: Link to display the help in the right menu.
* **Delete**: Button to delete the product. When you click on it, you have a modal to cancel or confirm the action.
* **Preview**: When you click on this button, it saves and open a new browser tab with the product displayed in front-office.      
If the product is disabled \(offline\), you have on the product page in front-office a message displayed: “This product is not visible to your customers.”       
Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + V
* **Online**: When you click on this button, it saves and makes the product visible in front-office.
* **Offline**: When you click on this button, it saves and makes the product invisible in front-office.
* **Save**: Button to save all changes made in all tabs.      
Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + S.      
If it’s saved with success, there is a green success message “Settings updated”. Otherwise, there is an error message.
* **Duplicate**: When you click on this button, it saves and duplicates the current product \(the duplicated product will be offline\). The duplicated product has all the product information (related products, shipping configuration, associated suppliers, combinations, associated and attached files) of the copied product.
Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + D      
* **Go to catalog**: When you click on this button, it saves and redirect to catalog product list.      
Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + Q
* **Add new product**: When you click on this button, it saves and opens a new empty product page.       
Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + P

When merchant leaves the product page for a product that have never been saved, a pop up is displayed to confirm the action. If the merchant confirms then the product is deleted otherwise the merchant stay on the product page.

### Basic settings tab \[[EPIC](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14763)\]

**As a merchant I want to be able to complete the basic information of my products.**

It is necessary to save the basic settings tab informations in order to access the combinaition tab. Until saved, other tabs are disabled with a tooltip on hover. 
Here are the mockup of the disabled tabs behavior: https://invis.io/3RWZILBJWQH#/414747857_Disabled_Tabs___Tooltip

Here is the list of the elements of basic settings tab:

* **Combinations**: If you have selected standard product in the drop-down, you have 2 radios buttons: simple product or product with combinations.      
If product with combination is selected, under the two radio buttons, there is a “combinations” link. When you click on it, you switch to combinations tab.      
If product with combinations was selected & combinations were generated, when I change for simple product, a modal is displayed alerting all combinations will be deleted and ask to confirm or cancel the action.
* **Reference**: The reference is displayed in the product details part in front-office.
* **Summary**: The text can be formatted thanks to the TinyMCE editor \([improvement 14985](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14985)\)          
A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed \(disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down\). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic \([improvement 16299](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16299)\)
* **Description**: The text can be formatted thanks to the TinyMCE editor \([improvement 14985](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14985)\)

It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic \([improvement 16299](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16299)\)
* **Quantity**: This field is not displayed for a product with combinations. This field is not displayed if stock management is disabled in Shop parameters &gt; Products settings.       
If simple product is selected, under the quantity field, there is a “quantities” link. When you click on it, you switch to quantities tab \(for a standard product\) or to virtual product tab \(for a virtual product\).       
When you update the field in basic settings tab, the same field in quantities \(for a standard product\) / virtual product tab is updated.       
The quantity is displayed in front-office if the option “Display available quantities on the product page” in Shop parameters &gt; Product settings is set to yes.          
This value is decremented when an order is placed except if the order status is Payement error. This value is incremented when the order status is cancelled, when you make a partial refund and check “Re-stock products” and when you return products and check “Re-stock products”.
* **Price tax excl**: When a value is filled, the price tax incl field is calculated automatically according to the tax rule chosen.       
To separate decimals a dot or a comma can be used, both should work no matter the language.      
When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.
* **Price tax incl**: This field shouldn't be displayed if taxes are disabled in International &gt; Taxes \([issue 15330](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/15330)\).      
When a value is filled, the price tax excl field is calculated automatically according to the tax rule chosen.      
To separate decimals a dot or a comma can be used, both should work no matter the language.       
When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.
* **Tax rule**: This field shouldn't be displayed if taxes are disabled in International &gt; Taxes \([issue 15330](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/15330)\).       
Drop-down with all tax rules enabled and a “no tax” option. 
If there are several taxes rules with the same name, then the ID of the tax rule is displayed before its name.
When you change it, the price tax incl is updated. And the “tax rule” field in Pricing tab is also changed.      
If you select an United States tax rule, price tax incl = price tax excl because it is a tax per state and we can not say in which state is the shop.       
When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.      
Under the tax rule drop down, there is a “pricing” link. When you click on it, you switch to pricing tab.
