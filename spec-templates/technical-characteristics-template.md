# SPECS PRODUCT PAGE

As a merchant I need to be able to correctly create, edit and delete my products.

## WHY

The add / edit product page \(Catalog &gt; Products\) has already been migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.0 version, but many behaviours are not specified which have introduced regressions and bugs. We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test and avoid any new bugs.

Furthermore, we have identified different issues related to this page that we should fix during the re-migration : [https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891)

## WHAT

Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with when creating / editing a product for his/her customers.

## SPECIFICATIONS

[The first step is to detail the behavior of each field per tab when creating / editing a product.](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/back-office/catalog/catalog-products-add-edit.md#product-creation-edition)

[The second step of this document is to detail the type of each fields and error messages per tab.](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/back-office/catalog/catalog-products-add-edit.md#errors)

The third step is to detail the multistore behavior.

### Elements in all tabs \[[EPIC](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14770)\]

**As a merchant I want to always see some elements when I create or edit a product.**

Some elements are displayed in all tabs. Here is the list of those elements :

* **Product name**: When you create a new product, this field is empty and there is a placeholder: “Enter your product name”.
Only the name in the default language must be filled, if the product name is not filled for all languages, then it must retrieve the product name in the default language.
A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed \(disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down\). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed.
If the content does not exist in a language, it must retrieve the content of the default language. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic.
* **Product type**: Drop-down with 3 : Standard product, Pack of products, Virtual product.
Please note, when editing a standard product with combinations, you can’t change the type, the drop-down is disabled.
* **Sales**: This link redirect to Stats &gt; product detail and is open in a new browser tab
* **Product list**: Link that displays the list of all products filtered as in the catalog, with their id, name, price, quantity.
If you click on the id or the name, you arrive on the product page in basic settings tab.
If you click on the price, you arrive on the product page in pricing tab.
If you click on the quantity, you arrive on the product page in the second tab which is: Quantities for a standard product without combinations or a pack, Combinations for a standard product with combination, Virtual product for a virtual product.
* **Help**: Link to display the help in the right menu.
* **Delete**: Button to delete the product. When you click on it, you have a modal to cancel or confirm the action.
* **Preview**: When you click on this button, it saves and open a new browser tab with the product displayed in front-office.
If the product is disabled \(offline\), you have on the product page in front-office a message displayed: “This product is not visible to your customers.”

* **Offline**: When you click on this button, it saves and makes the product invisible in front-office.

If it’s saved with success, there is a green success message “Settings updated”. Otherwise, there is an error message.

Here is the list of the elements of basic settings tab:

* **Combinations**: If you have selected standard product in the drop-down, you have 2 radios buttons: simple product or product with combinations.
If product with combination is selected, under the two radio buttons, there is a “combinations” link. When you click on it, you switch to combinations tab.
If product with combinations was selected & combinations were generated, when I change for simple product, a modal is displayed alerting all combinations will be deleted and ask to confirm or cancel the action.
* **Reference**: The reference is displayed in the product details part in front-office.

When you update the field in basic settings tab, the same field in quantities \(for a standard product\) / virtual product tab is updated.
The quantity is displayed in front-office if the option “Display available quantities on the product page” in Shop parameters &gt; Product settings is set to yes.
This value is decremented when an order is placed except if the order status is Payement error. This value is incremented when the order status is cancelled, when you make a partial refund and check “Re-stock products” and when you return products and check “Re-stock products”.
* **Price tax excl**: When a value is filled, the price tax incl field is calculated automatically according to the tax rule chosen.

When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.
Under the tax rule drop down, there is a “pricing” link. When you click on it, you switch to pricing tab.
