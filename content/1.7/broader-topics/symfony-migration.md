**SYMFONY MIGRATION GUIDELINES**

For UX, some guidelines have been defined for each most types of page in the back-office : table and grid pages, configuration pages, drag & drop, etc. These redesigns are made gradually as the development skills and migration progress. This is why no design has been specified for CRUD \(with create - read - update - delete actions\) pages.

Please note that many pages in the BO have very specific behaviour and need their own redesign. This is why it is crucial to follow the roadmap which have been defined, in order to anticipate sketch needs.

**1\) Tables**

In tables and listings, some improvements and changes in behaviour have been decided :

* Search : when searching for an ID "X", only the element with this exact ID should be displayed. Previously, all elements including this ID were being shown.
* Filter :

**2\) Tables with drag & drop**

**3\) Add new / other actions**

**4\) Configuration blocks**
