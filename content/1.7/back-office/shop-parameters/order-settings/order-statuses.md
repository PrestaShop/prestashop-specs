If the user was on another page in a specific shop context or in a group context, the all shops context is automatically selected when he/she arrives on the page.

An information message is displayed at the top of the page: "Note that this page is available in all shops context only, this is why your context has just switched." (_See issue [#19495](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/19495)_)

#### Pagination

The pagination of the list starts when there are more than 20 order statuses.

The merchant can select the number of order statuses displayed through a drop-down: 20, 50, 300, 1000

When there are more results than the number selected, the merchant can navigate through pages.

If a sort and/or a search have been done, results should be kept when moving on to the next page.

### Add / edit order status

When **adding a new order status or editing an order status**, the user can fulfill the information below:
*   **Status name**, mandatory information
*   **Icon**. (to be removed after migration since it is not used anymore),
*   **Color** select the color through the color picker or write the hexadecimal code. By default the value is #ffffff. If the form is submited without color, then the status name isn't visible (see _[issue #21284](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/21284)_)

The user can customize the order status actions by checking the different options below:

*   **Consider the associated order as validated.** If enabled, this status marks all associated orders as "paid"
*   **Allow a customer to download and view PDF versions of their invoice.** If enabled, the invoice can be downloadable in the  Order History page in the Front Office.
*   **Hide this state in all customer orders.** If enabled, the status is hidden in the Order History page in the Front Office.
*   **Send an e-mail to the customer when his/her order status has changed**. 

When **enabled**, a **drop-down menu appears on the bottom of the option** to let you choose which mail template to use for the sending email. 

**A preview button** is available to preview the email that is going to be sent.

### Order status properties

*   **Attach invoice PDF to an email** - Checkbox 

WHEN checked  
THEN it sends an email to the customer with the invoice in PDF format attached.

*   **Attach a delivery slip PDF to an email** - Checkbox

WHEN checked   
THEN it sends an email to the customer with the delivery slip in PDF format attached.

*   **Set the order as shipped.** - Checkbox

WHEN checked   
THEN the flag **shipped** from the order is activated 

*   **Set the order as paid.** - Checkbox

WHEN checked   
THEN the flag **paid** from the order is activated 

*   **Set the order as in transit.** - Checkbox - 

WHEN checked   
THEN the flag **delivery** from the order is activated AND it generates the Delivery Slip.

WHEN a order is set **as paid** OR **as shipped** OR **as in transit**   
THEN the flag can't be remove from the order.

Next to the label name and email template preview, there is a drop-down to select the language the user wants to edit or view the information.

The order statuses can be displayed on:
*   the Order List Page
*   the Order View Page
*   the Customer Thread Page in Orders and messages timeline block
*   the Order History Page

Note that it is not possible to delete default order statuses such as Payment accepted, Delivered, etc. These PrestaShop order statuses can only be modified.

![page status edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13449658/110355532-a2567b80-8039-11eb-9721-f13b31d9a1b4.png)

#### Multistore behavior

As the Add/Edit form does not display any shop association block, **when merchants add or edit an order status, it is added to all shops or edited for all shops** - no matter the context selected. 

An information message should be displayed at the top of the page to inform the user of this behavior: "Note that this feature is available in all shops context only. It will be added to all your stores." (_See issue [#19496](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/19496)_)

So all order status should be displayed in the listing, be it an all shops, a group, or a specific shop context.

#### Default order return statuses

By default, PrestaShop has the following order return statuses: 
- id 1:	Waiting for confirmation	
- id 2:	Waiting for package	
- id 3:	Package received	
- id 4:	Return denied	
- id 5:	Return completed	

**The first return status generated** in the return workflow is **“Waiting for confirmation”** when the customer creates a return demand in the Front Office. 

### Add / edit order return status

When **adding or editing a new order return status**, the user can fulfill the information below:
*   **Status name** mandatory information
*   **Color** select the color through the color picker or write the hexadecimal code. By default the value is #ffffff. If the form is submited without color, then the status name isn't visible (see _[issue #21284](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/21284)_)

![page status return edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13449658/110355668-c74aee80-8039-11eb-8ef9-e2e1fda404cd.png)

**The order return status can be displayed on:**
*   the Order Follow page in Front Office customer account,
*   the Order View page in Back-Office on merchandise return tab, 
*   the Merchandise Returns List Page,
*   the Merchandise Returns Edit Page.

**Adding new** return status will add new return status on the Merchandise Returns Edit Page return status droplist.

Note that it is not possible to delete default return statuses such as Waiting for confirmation, Package received, etc. These PrestaShop return statuses can only be modified.

#### Multistore behavior

As the Add/Edit form does not display any shop association block, **when merchants add or edit an order return status, it is added to all shops or edited for all shops** - no matter the context selected. 

An information message should be displayed at the top of the page to inform the user of this behavior: "Note that this feature is available in all shops context only. It will be added to all your stores." (_See issue [#19497](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/19497)_)

So all order status should be displayed in the listing, be it an all shops, a group, or a specific shop context.

## Specific cases

When deleting an order status or a return status, there is currently no check on the order database, to ensure that there is no order currently using this status. This can provoke errors and exceptions (as described on the following issue : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/19098), on several pages : 
  - the order history page in FO (exception)
  - the Order detail page in BO (exception)
  - the order listing page in BO (no exception, but the status is not displayed)
  - the customer page
  
 To prevent this situation, an improvement has been introduced (178 version) changing the order status hard delete into a soft delete, setting the "deleted" value to 1, so that the status can be retrieved in DB even after it has been deleted, preventing orders having this status to break.

For order listing and detail pages in B0, this means that when a user deletes a previously created order or return status, it will :
- flag the order status as deleted (soft delete) meaning that it will no longer be visible in the order statuses list but will still be available in database
- For orders with this status as their current status : leave it visible in the order status droplist (with (deleted) displayed) until another one is selected
- once another one is selected, remove it from the droplist so that it cannot be chosen or seen anymore

For the order history page in FO, it will stay transparent for the user, as the deleted status will still be displayed in the customer's order history.

For the customer page, this improvement fixes the exception while having no other impact on the page.
