![Administration](static/img/configure-administration.png)

This UI is responsible for General, Upload, and Notifications settings of the webshop.

## Top UI section

- **Multishop switcher** - it is an ability to switch the available multistores while being on the current SEO editing page, and to view the shop Front-Office homepage by redirection.
- **Breadcrumbs, page title, Recommended modules and Help CTA's** - default Prestashop UI in the top position, helping administrators to improve the navigation - to view the current Title of the page, see the level of the navigation.

## General section

All the settings are marked as required. The following settings are:
- **Automatically check for module updates** - toggle switch, by default it is enabled - it initiates the automatic Prestashop module updates checking. If there will be a newer module released in Addons Marketplcace, the system will show the notifications, about the available module updates. The description says _Choose a stability level for the modules downloaded from the Addons Marketplace. All zips pushed on Addons are in stable state unless stated otherwise._ and that means, that updating the modules with the newest will impact the webshop stability.
