# ADVANCED PARAMETERS > DATABASE > DB BACKUP

![Database Backup UI](static/img/configure-db-backup.png)

This UI displays the webshop Databse backuping functionality features.

## Top UI section

- **Multishop switcher** - it is an ability to switch the available multistores while being on the current Database backup page, and to view the shop Front-Office homepage by redirection.
- **Breadcrumbs, page title, Recommended modules and Help CTA's** - default Prestashop UI in the top position, helping administrators to improve the navigation - to view the current Title of the page, see the level of the navigation.
- **Tabs** - there are 2 tabs in the DB Backup section:
  - **SQL Manager**
  - **DB Backup** - highlighted tab.

## Top notifications

First blue-boxed **notification**, that informs about All Shops context - _Note that this feature is available in all shops context only. It will be added to all your stores._, meaning, that the Database backups will be taken from all the shops at the same time, not related to single webshop. 

**Disclaimer** - effective reminding plan for webshop administrator, before creating a Database backup.
