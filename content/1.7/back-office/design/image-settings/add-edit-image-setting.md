## Adding or editing Image type UI

![Adding or editing Image type panel](static/img/image-settings-add-edit-image-type.png)

This configuration UI is about adding the new Image type into the Image type listing.

During default Image type configuration, the notification is prompted as error: <br>
_By default, all images settings are already installed in your store. Do not delete them, you will need it!_

After setting up the Image type configuration, the UI prompts the warning notification: <br>
_After modification, do not forget to regenerate thumbnails_

There are the following input text fields, that can be set:

- **Name for the image type**  - this is a required field, that describes the main name of the image type. The image type name should be used with underscores and hyphens only.

 ## Call to action 
 There are 2 buttons at the bottom of this page: 
 - **Cancel**: The image type is not added/edited and the image settings page is displayed
 - **Save**: In the case of adding an image type and if there is no error, the image type is added and a success message is displayed on the top of image settings page : "Successful creation.". In the case of editing an image type, the image is edited and a success message is displayed on the top of the image settings page : "Successful update.".

## Multistore behavior

The fields listed above don't have checkboxes and are available in all contexts (all shops, group, single store).
Images types are set for all shops, no matter the context selected.
