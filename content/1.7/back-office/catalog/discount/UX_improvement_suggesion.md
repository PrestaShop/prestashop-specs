## Discounts page

When user navigates to Catalog > Discounts, the main Discount tab is "Cart rules". It is kinda strange, from users' perspective in psychological side, because user is expecting to get all the information about Catalog funcionalities, and Catalog rules makes more sense from UX side instantly.

I suggest to switch the "Catalog Cart rules" tab to the first tab place, when navigting to the Catalog > Discounts.
