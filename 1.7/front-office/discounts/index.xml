      <description>SPECIFICATIONS - FREE GIFT USAGE DURING CHECKOUT Use the free gift cart rule As a customer, I want my free gift cart rule to be taken into account in my shopping cart.
When a merchant creates in the back office a cart rule with a &amp;lsquo;free gift&amp;rsquo; option, it means that only one item (of the product selected as a gift) is offered. In the front office, customers can purchase additional quantity for this product but they should pay for n-1 items; customers can shop more of the free gift item, only the additional items will be charged.</description>
