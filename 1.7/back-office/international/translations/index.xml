      <description>Translations Conceptual vocabulary Wordings: original texts found throughout the software. Although these messages are written in English, they are actually only tokens to be translated into any language, including English variations (eg. British, American). Translations: wordings translated to a given language. Translation domain: named logic group of wordings. Any given wording is attached to one and only one translation domain. Two identical wordings attached to two different translation domains are considered as two different wordings.</description>
