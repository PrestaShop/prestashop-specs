      <description>Stores listing This page lists all the stores. The stores enabled are displayed in the corresponding &amp;ldquo;stores&amp;rdquo; page of the front office.
Multistore Only the stores created in the selected store or store group (through the context) are displayed.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say I have the following configuration:
 Group 1  Shop A Shop B   Group 2  Shop C    If I select group 1 as context, then the stores created in Shop A and Shop B will be displayed.</description>
