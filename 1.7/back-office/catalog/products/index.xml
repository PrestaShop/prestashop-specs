      <description>SPECS PRODUCT PAGEAs a merchant I need to be able to correctly create, edit and delete my products.&#xA;WHYThe add / edit product page (Catalog &amp;gt; Products) has already been migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.0 version, but many behaviours are not specified which have introduced regressions and bugs. We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test and avoid any new bugs.</description>

      <description>SPECS PRODUCT PAGE Add a new product As a merchant, when I create a new product, I want to select the type of product before.&#xA;When I press add new product button, a modal is displayed.&#xA;The modal lists all the PrestaShop product types (standard product, combination product, virtual product, and products’ pack). A simple product is selected by default.&#xA;Each product type has its shorts&amp;rsquo; description. Selecting a product type displays its description.</description>
