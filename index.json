	"description": "",
	"content": "Orders \u0026gt; Orders \u0026gt; Add new order\nAs a merchant, I want to be able to manually add an order to my back-office. Creating a new order is divided into 6 steps:\n I. Customer selection with his/her old orders and carts II. Order cart III. Vouchers IV. Address V. Summary VI. Multistore  I. Customer selection To select the customer, the merchant has to type any character chain that is contained in the customer\u0026rsquo;s first name, last name, or email.\nIf there is no match between the search and the results, a warning notification “No customers found” is displayed.\nAdd new customer button next to search input opens the page Add new customer in case the customer does not exist in the merchant database.\nThe search can return multiple customers. Each matching customer is displayed on a card with the customer\u0026rsquo;s :\n first name, last name, ID, email, date of birth.  The card\u0026rsquo;s footer has 2 buttons:\n Details button that redirects the merchant to the customer page. Choose button that allows the merchant to proceed to the next step. It selects the customer for the Order and highlights his/her card in green. The search bar and \u0026ldquo;Add new customer\u0026rdquo; button are not displayed anymore. Choose button is changed into Change button.  Choose button displays the 50 latest orders and carts into 2 tabs. The tabs are displayed by default and can be hidden by pressing the arrow.\nCarts tab displays a table with the customer\u0026rsquo;s cart ID, date, and total tax included sorted by ID in descending order.\nOrders tab displays a table with the customer\u0026rsquo;s order ID, date, total paid tax included or excluded (depending on group configuration), payment method, and status sorted by ID in descending order.\nEach old cart and order can be previewed by pressing on the Details button or used as a base for the new order by pressing the button Use. The Use button clears all fulfilled inputs and selected options to replace them with the data from the old cart or order.\nADD SPECIFIC ON WHAT IS CLEARED AND REPLACED\nChange button can be pressed at any time in the order creation. It displays the search bar and \u0026ldquo;Add new customer\u0026rdquo; button to select a new customer in a new blank order (clears all fulfilled inputs and selected options).\nII. The order cart After selecting the customer, the merchant can configure his customer cart. A search bar is displayed to add a product to the cart. The search returns one product that is the closest to the product name or reference.\nIf the product has combinations, it displays all the combinations available into a droplist. Before adding the product to a cart, the user has to fulfill the desired quantity (by default the quantity is set to 1).\nBelow the input, a label displays the product stock.\nPressing the button \u0026ldquo;Add to cart\u0026rdquo; button, adds the product to the product table below the button.\nAdding a simple product, a product with combination or a virtual product If the product added has availability preferences to deny orders, the product is only added if there is enough quantity available. The quantity available has to be equal or superior to the quantity selected. Otherwise, an error is thrown: \u0026ldquo;There are not enough products in stock\u0026rdquo;.\nIf the added product has availability preferences to allow orders, the product is added regardless of the product quantity.\nThe available quantity of the product decreases according to the selected quantity after the product is added.\nAdding a pack of product When the pack has availability preferences to deny order: the cart checks the stock availability depending on the quantities parameter of the pack. If the quantities parameter of the pack is:\n Decrement pack only, the verification of the quantity available checks the quantity available of the pack. Decrement products in pack only, the verification of the quantity available checks the quantity of the products of the pack (all the products have to be available). Decrement both, the verification of the quantity available checks the quantity of the products of the pack (all the products have to be available) and the quantity of the pack. Depending the different cases, the quantity available has to be equal or superior to the quantity selected. Otherwise, an error is thrown: \u0026ldquo;There are not enough products in stock\u0026rdquo;.  If the added product has availability preferences to allow orders then the product is added regardless of the product quantity of the pack.\nAfter the product is added to the cart depending on the quantities parameter of the pack:\n The available quantity of the pack decreases according to the selected quantity if the availability preference is to Decrement pack only. The available quantity of the products of the pack decreases according to the selected quantity if the availability preference is to Decrement products in the pack only. The available quantity of the pack and the products of the pack decrease according to the selected quantity if the availability preferences is to Decrement both.  The product table displays for each product, the product image, description, reference, base price without tax, quantity, and total price without tax. Each product line has a \u0026ldquo;Remove button\u0026rdquo; to delete the product from the cart when the product is added through the add to cart button.\nWarning \u0026ldquo;prices are without taxes\u0026rdquo; is displayed below the product table.\nThe base price and the quantity are editable.\nIf the quantity fulfilled is higher than the stock quantity, an error warning is displayed: \u0026ldquo;There are not enough products in stock\u0026rdquo;. If the edited value is negative, it displays an error: \u0026ldquo;Positive product quantity is required\u0026rdquo;.\nAn edition of the base price or the quantity updates the total by multiplying the base price by the quantity.\nIn the cart block, the merchant can configure the order currency and language. By default, the language and the currency are set from the shop default language and the shop default currency.\nThe currency dropdown converts the base price and the total price in the product table in the new currency. If the base price was edited before converting the currency, it converts the base price from the edited base price.\nIII. Voucher When creating a manual order in the back-office, the merchant can :\n Add products to sell or product already sold Add cart rules associated with the cart Define all elements of the order (address, order status, type of payment, etc.)  Some specific cases can occur and need to be detailed, especially when gift products included in cart rules are added to the cart.\nBelow are listed all different behaviors:\n- Adding a cart rule with conditions that the cart does not reach\nWhen trying to add a cart rule to the manually created order, there should be a check on the conditions of this cart rule. If the current cart does not reach the expected conditions, there should be an error message stating that the order does not reach the required amount to use this voucher.\n- Adding a cart rule with a classic discount (amount or percentage or free shipping)\nWhen adding a cart rule with a discount or free shipping voucher, there is no impact on the cart but a new line is added in the Cart rule block with information about the voucher :\n The voucher name The voucher description The value of the discount (tax included)  - Adding a cart rule with a gift product (different than products already in the cart)\nWhen adding a cart rule with a free product that is different than products already available in the cart, the newly created cart rule is displayed in the voucher block with a few information :\n The voucher name The voucher description The initial price of the product (tax included)  The gifted product is also automatically added to the cart with base price and price replaced with “Gift”. It is not possible to remove it directly from the cart. There is no “Remove” button for gift products. It is only possible to remove it by removing the associated cart rule.\n- Adding a cart rule with a gift product + discount on the cart\nWhen a voucher effect is \u0026ldquo;Free Gift\u0026rdquo; + something else (Free shipping, Amount discount, or percent discount), the voucher should be displayed only once, with the value information adding all discounts together. For instance, if the voucher offers a 10€ discount (tax included) + a free product with a 5€ unit value (tax included), then the value column of the voucher should display 15€.\nIn the meantime, the gifted product is automatically added to the cart with base price and price replaced with “Gift” (just as in the scenario above).\nIt is not possible to remove it directly from the cart. There is no “Remove” button for gift products. It is only possible to remove it by removing the associated cart rule.\n- Adding several cart rules with always the same gift product\nIn the same manual order, when adding several vouchers that offer the same product (with the same combinations) as a gift, there should be only one line for the product with the quantity updated with all gifted products. It works the same way as in the cart details (when choosing an already existing cart)\nBase price and prices are replaced with “Gift”.\nWhen removing a voucher, it should remove one quantity from the products. It is not possible to remove the product directly from the cart. There is no “Remove” button for gift products. It is only possible to remove it by removing the associated cart rule.\nIt is not possible to change the quantity (increase/decrease) of a product when all units are gift products.\n- Adding a gift product which is already available as a paid product in the cart\nExample: adding the \u0026ldquo;Best is yet to come Mug\u0026rdquo; once as a paid item, and four times as a gift (with 4 different vouchers). Current situation (bug): There is one line for each mug in the cart, with a quantity set to \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo; each time, instead of being set to \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; for each. When I create the order, the total quantity for the mug is OK (5 products, and not 25).\nAll identical products (same product with the same ID with the same combinations) should be put together even though some are paid, some others are free. In the end, when transforming the cart in order, all products are grouped together.\nIn the cart when reducing the quantity it should remove only paid products. It means if for a product there are 3 quantities in the cart with 1 product being paid and 2 offered as gifts, the merchant should only be able to reduce one quantity related to the paid product. To remove free products, he should remove the related vouchers.\nThere is no remove button for products that have both paid and gift units. To remove the product, the merchant has to remove all cart rules related to gift products and then remove the paid product.\nThe price should be calculated by summing all values from the paid products together. For example, if there is one product being paid (price 10€), and 2 products offered, then the final indicated price should be 10€.\n- Adding a paid product which is already available as a gift product in the cart\nExample: If I already have a gifted product in my cart (with quantity \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;), and I want to add the same product but paid this time. This scenario can only occur if I already had a product in my cart. Current bugs :\n when I try to add the same product but paid, an error is displayed \u0026ldquo;Same product quantity is already in cart\u0026rdquo; and nothing is added. If I have two gifted products (same product), and then I try to add the same product but paid, the two gifted products are replaced by only one gifted product (and no paid product).  Expected behavior: the same behavior as above should occur:” All identical products (same product with the same ID and the same combinations) should be put together even though some are paid, some others are free. In the end, when transforming the cart in order, all products are grouped together.”\nThis means that when adding a product that is already in the cart, this should add one quantity to the product, and change the price accordingly.\nSame scenarios when removing products/vouchers and changing quantities.\n- Adding a cart rule with free shipping\nIf I add to the order a free shipping cart rule (with code) limited to a specific carrier, then the cart rule should be automatically removed if the specific carrier isn\u0026rsquo;t selected anymore.\nIf I select a carrier associated with a free shipping cart rule without code, then the voucher should be added automatically to the order when the carrier is selected. And should be automatically removed when the carrier isn\u0026rsquo;t selected anymore.\nThe value of the voucher should be the same as the value of the carrier (if the carrier is concerned by the cart rule). Example: Carrier A = 10€ Carrier B = 15€ Cart rule = free shipping for if carrier A or carrier B is selected If I select carrier A, then the voucher value is 10€ If I select carrier B, the voucher value is 15€\n- Deleting a paid product\nDeleting a paid product is very easy, a Remove button is available to remove one or several quantities of a paid product. Current bug: if I delete the paid product, it will also delete the gifted product (the voucher is still displayed). The deletion should only delete the paid product.\nIf I have a paid product, and the same product, but gifted, in my cart, I should not have a Remove button available on the product line. The remove button only appears when there are no longer gift products on the same product line.\n- Deleting a gift product\nYou are not allowed to delete a gift product from the cart, it’s only possible by removing the associated cart rule.\nIV. Order\u0026rsquo;s Addresses The Addresses block displays 2 droplists: for the delivery address and for the invoice. The droplist displays all the addresses related to the customer.\nEditing an address\nOnce an address has been associated with a completed order (created by the user from the Back-Office or the Front-Office), the association can never be changed. If a customer decides to change the address for his new order while in his old orders the invoice was addressed to his old address, then changing it will potentially change the address of these old orders while the destination was correct at that time. To avoid impacting the old addresses when editing the address, the software will follow the following rules:\n  When the user edits an address, PrestaShop checks if it has been associated yet with an order, if it\u0026rsquo;s not the address is regularly edited.\n  If the merchant tries to edit an address (invoice or delivery) already associated with an order, PrestaShop detects that and instead of editing directly the existing address, it copies the existing address, applies the new modification, and reassigns the order\u0026rsquo;s delivery or invoice address with the newly created address, while the former one is saved and soft-deleted (marked as \u0026ldquo;deleted\u0026rdquo; in the database). The soft-delete will allow old orders to keep the old address meanwhile the new order will only see the new defined address.\n  When delivery and invoice addresses are the same and the merchant edits one of them, both of them will be edited.\n  Add new address\nBelow the addresses, there is a button “add new address” that allows the user through pop-in of the address to add a new address. Once the new address is saved, the address is added into the addresses droplist for the address of the delivery and the invoice.\nV. Shipping The merchant can select the carrier through the drop-down. The shipping price is displayed according to the carrier selected and the free shipping toggle. A free shipping toggle is displayed. By default free shipping is disabled. If it\u0026rsquo;s enabled then, the shipping price is set 0,00.\nIf the gift wrapping option is enabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Order settings, then a toggle \u0026ldquo;Gift wrapping\u0026rdquo; and a field \u0026ldquo;Gift wrapping message\u0026rdquo; are displayed. If the recycled packaging option is enabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Order settings, then a toggle \u0026ldquo;Recycled packaging\u0026rdquo; is displayed.\nEnabling the gift wrapping or the recycled packaging will display the corresponding label on the order view page (cf Specs Order view \u0026gt; V. Tabs panel).\nVI. Order\u0026rsquo;s Summary Total summary This final section shows you all the final product price (the sum of the product prices only tax excluded), total vouchers (the sum of the discounts accorded to the order tax excluded), total shipping (total shipping price taxes excluded), total taxes, total with taxes excluded and the total with taxes included.\nOrder message The merchant can add a message to the order. After the creation, the message is displayed in the \u0026ldquo;Messages\u0026rdquo; panel of the order detail page as a private message: with a dark background and the specific icon for the sender pic.\nInvalid characters are: \u0026lt;\u0026gt;{} When you save, if your order message contains an invalid character, an error notification should be displayed “The order message given is invalid”.\nSend an email to the customer with the link to process the payment This button allows sending an email to the customer with the link to process the payment It\u0026rsquo;s not related to the payment method selected.\nNext to this button is a hyperlink to allow the user to proceed to the payment directly in the front office. Clicking this hyperlink opens a new tab that redirects the user to the payment step of the checkout process for this order - the user does not need to fill all the personal information, addresses, or shipping method but he must be able to navigate through those previous steps before going back to the payment.\nProcessing the payment through the checkout in the front office automatically creates the order and adds it to the orders listing in the back office. As a consequence, the merchant does not have to complete the ongoing creation of the new order.\nIf the payment is not processed right away, the merchant must keep on completing the creation form in the back office and click \u0026lsquo;Create new order\u0026rsquo; to add it to the orders listing.\nPayment and order status Expected behaviour The default value of the payment method and the status drop list in the droplist is \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash; Choose \u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;.\nSo to create the order, the user must select an order status and a payment method. An error message is thrown if the user has not chosen a status or payment method: \u0026ldquo;PLease, select an item in the list\u0026rdquo;.\nVI. Multstore On all the group shops, the button “add new order” is hidden. It’s only shown when you are in a specific shop.\n"

	"content": "SPECIFICATIONS - CATALOG \u0026gt; DISCOUNTS \u0026gt; CATALOG PRICE RULES User Story : As a merchant I need to be able to correctly create and edit discounts to my customers based on specific conditions, such as product quantity or category, combinations or brands.\nWHY The Add/edit catalog price rule page (Catalog \u0026gt; Discounts \u0026gt; Catalog price rules) is expected to be migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.7 version, but many behaviours (especially for complex rules) are not well specified which may introduce regressions and bugs. We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test every scenario and avoid any new bugs.\nFurthermore, we have identified different issues and bugs related to this page that we should fix during the migration :\n #9881 : not reproduced so far #13791 : should be fixed with the migration #9977 #9867  WHAT Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with when creating a specific type of discount for his/her customers. This specification should specifically define :\n Condition groups behaviour and compatibility Compatibility between rules Discounts display on front office  SPECIFICATIONS The first step of this document is to detail global and generic expected behaviour for this page, both on back office and front office. The second step gives a specific definition of scenarios and behaviours involving conditions groups. The last step details specs for cases with several rules.\nCatalog price rules list Catalog price rule creation / edition on Back office When creating or editing a catalog price rule, the first step is to create the generic conditions of the rules. Some conditions or elements are mandatory, others are optional, according to the expected target audience. Here is the list of those elements :\n Name : this is a mandatory field - every rules need to have a name. Shop: If multistore is enabled and if several shops are configured, this drop-down allows to select to which store the catalog price rule will be associated - by default, the first shop created is selected. Currency : the merchant can choose to apply the rule only on one of his/her currencies enabled on the website (or all currencies) - this is an optional criterion Country : same as above, the merchant can choose all countries or only one of the enabled countries as a target audience - this is an optional criterion Group : same as above, the merchant can choose only one or all created customer groups - this is an optional criterion From quantity : the merchant needs to choose the minimum quantity necessary to trigger the discount - this is a mandatory field. By default, 1 is chosen. Price (tax excl.) : by default, this field is disabled. It becomes enabled only when the merchant removes the check mark from “Leave initial price” option. The price field becomes mandatory when the option is disabled. From / to : the user can choose to create a temporary discount, with a start date and/or an end date. When clicking on one field, the merchant is able to configure the day, month and year but also the hour and minute. Those 2 fields are optional. Reduction type : the discount can be either in amount (-X€) or in percentage (-X%). By default the discount is preconfigured in amount.  Note : there are currently 2 issues when choosing the percentage type.\n It does not take into account if it is tax included or excluded. When choosing the percentage type, we should remove the option tax included / excluded, as it is for cart rules. It is possible to create a percentage discount \u0026gt; 100%. I think we should limit it to 100%.   Reduction with or without taxes : the discount can be considered tax excluded (expected by default) or tax included. Reduction : in this field, the merchant needs to define the discount value. This is a mandatory field, by default its value is 0.  Impact on Front office  Discount applied on quantity = 1  If the merchant chooses to create a discount from 1 product, then the discount label is automatically displayed on the product and on the product page.\nEx :\nSpecific case : when a product already has an active specific price, the catalog price rule is not applied to it.\n Discount applied on quantity\u0026gt; 1  When a discount is applied only after buying more than 1 quantity of the same product, there should be no label displayed on the product. Instead, there should be a grid available on the product page detailing the discount conditions.\nEx :\nWhen adding at least the minimum expected quantity, a discount label is added to the product page, and in the cart.\nEx:\n Discount applied on the initial price  If the initial price has been modified, it modifies the final price on each product to be paid by the user.\nAdding one or several condition groups Once the basic conditions have been defined, it is possible to add one or several other condition groups to refine the rule. When clicking on “Add a new condition group”, a new block “Condition Group 1” is added above.\nThose conditions are related to :\n Category : the merchant can choose to apply discount only on products which belong to the chosen category. Brand : the merchant can choose to apply a discount on a specific brand only Supplier : same as above Attributes : same as above, the merchant can choose to apply a discount on a specific attribute. To do so, he needs to choose the attribute type and a specific value. Features : same as above.  It is possible to add several sets of conditions in the same group, but also to create different condition groups in the same rule.\n  When adding different criteria to the same group, this works as an AND relation. Ex : Category Women and Brand Nike - the rule will only apply to product which belong to the women category and whose brand is Nike.\n  When adding different condition groups to the same rule, this work as an OR relation between all groups. Ex : Group 1 : Category Men and Group 2 : Brand Adidas - the rule will apply to all products which belong to the men category or to the Adidas brand.\n  There does not seem to be any restriction in the number of condition groups which can be created in the same rule.\nNote : currently, it is possible to create a condition group even though no criterion is selected, which does not make sense. We should disable the ‘Add a new condition group’ CTA when the current group is empty.\nAdding several rules Currently when several rules apply to the same product, it seems that there are different behaviours. We need to clarify them.\nEx 1 :\nThe test rule has the following conditions :\nTo the related products, a 10€ discount is automatically applied.\nThe test2 rule applies a 5€ discount on all product when quantity \u0026gt;=2.\nWhen I select a product which complies both rules, this happens in Front office :\nThe save 10€ label is automatically displayed, which is the expected behaviour. The discount grid is displayed on the product page according to “Rule 2” which is the expected behaviour.\nResults : If I add only one product, I will get a 10€ discount. If I add 2 products, then the discount will be of 5€ for each product. There is no combination of both rules.\nEx 2 : Same example but with 2 rules with the same minimum quantity. After a few tests, it seems that only the oldest rule will apply to the product. Other rules will have no effect on the product. Shouldn’t this be explained in the rules listing ?\n"

	"content": "SPECIFICATIONS CHECKLIST As a contributor, I want to know how to write complete specifications.\nAs a core team member, I want to deliver the most completed specifications in order to have accurate and qualitative development.\nMost of the time, each file corresponds to a specific page or a tab, whether it comes from the back office, the front office, or a module. It might happen to have a cross-functional feature to specify, that defines wide behaviors and impacts many different pages.\nIf the specifications template can be shaped depending on the feature, note that this checklist applies in any case as it allows everyone to lean on the most thorough specifications possible and therefore bring quality to the PrestaShop project.\nContext information Whether you are starting from scratch or specifying a use case, you might need to add some contextual elements. Answering the \u0026lsquo;Why?\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;What?\u0026rsquo; questions is an excellent start as it would help the community to understand how to read the specifications.\nIf the specifications are a bit long or describe several different cases, do not hesitate to add a table of contents with anchored links or explain how you structured the file.\nFinally, the key element is the user story. Feel free to add it whenever it is necessary following this template: As a [user], I want to [be able to do sthing] so that [I can achieve my outcome].\nFunctional behaviors   Mockups, if there are any links to share.\n  Helper cards, help merchants to have a better understanding of back office pages, they should be specified if there are any.\n  Empty states, appears only when there is no value, they should be specified if there are any.\n  Components, describe the feature type: table, drop-down selector, input field, switch button, etc. preferably right after the name of the concerned feature.\n  [ ] Default status, indicate its default state: enable, disable, already filled, selected, etc.\n  Descriptions, note how to use it: invalid characters, maximum length, actions triggered, etc.\n  [ ] Multilanguages, if this component can be localized according to the store\u0026rsquo;s languages.\n  Help notes, write down the expected available tooltips, placeholders, help texts, etc.\n  [ ] Notifications, add the warning, success, error, and information notifications displayed.\n  [ ] Issues, link the related bugs or improvements it specified if there are any.\n  RTL, if the page has some specifics behaviors in a right-to-left language.\n  Search \u0026amp; sort, table columns often have search fields and sort, this should be specified for each column if there are.\n  Bulk actions, table columns often have bulk-actions drop-down, this should be specified if there are.\n  Settings wheel, tables often have a settings wheel with options, this should be specified if there are.\n  Impacted pages Do not forget to add it to the dedicated file(s) when a feature impacts other places in the software!\nFor example, the most common case is activating/deactivating a setting in the back office that automatically enables/disables a field in the front office. In this case, specify both BO and FO behaviors.\nMultistore behaviors Behaviors might change when the multistore mode is enabled (Shop Parameters \u0026gt; General), and it is to specify as well. How is the feature supposed to work with the multistore? In a specific shop context, a group context, and an all shops context?\n:point_right: multistore general specs\n:point_right: multistore general specs\nPermission settings Access permissions can be set, based on the various team profiles, in the Advanced Parameters \u0026gt; Team section of the back office. For instance, the SuperAdmin has access to all BO features and, by default, logisticians cannot reach the Orders \u0026gt; Shopping Carts page.\nSince the \u0026lsquo;View\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Add\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Edit\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Delete\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Configure\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;Uninstall\u0026rsquo; rights of the pages and modules might not be granted to everyone, some behaviors are likely to change depending on the profile accessing it. Double-check the feature with this particularity in mind in case it needs to be added to the specifications. ;-)\nAcceptance tests Last but not least, it will be much appreciated by the QA team if the specifications could contain user acceptance tests. Follow the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format to write them down: Given [the context], when [I perform this action], then [I should get this behavior].\n RTL Multistore Multilanguage  Specifications templates Want to have a precise overview of how should your specifications look like?

Each merchant has his own currency format problematics, so we allow the merchant to custom the currency format depending on the language of their shops.\nThe currency format will have now be fully customizable assisted by the CLDR.\nReminder, the CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) is a database containing the convention of different languages as format date, currencies and more shared by the biggest companies. It will be the main source to provide the best currencies pre-configuration to the merchant.\nThe merchant doesn’t have to worry about their currencies display anymore but they still can edit if needed. Their shop won’t look suspicious because of a wrong currency displayed. The currency display will adapt itself to every customer.\nSPECIFICATION The implementation of the CLDR database and the feature to change the currency display in the FO by language is already done (Here the first part #10052).\nRemaining improvements features of the Page Add Currency and Edit Currency in Page Currencies of Localization Category is the format setting. It allows:\n To edit currency symbol by language To edit symbol position by language for all the currencies The separating symbol of thousands and decimals is only configured by the CLDR  It’s the second part of the page currency adding and edition. It has the languages list with the currency display according to the language next to it. It will be possible for the merchant to edit the currency format or to reset it by language. By default, the format setting (position and symbol, decimals, separating symbol) is configured by the CLDR.\nOLD SPECIFICATION  10058 11690  DETAILED SPECIFICATION Grid CurrencyGridDefinitionFactory.php Default action in the button: Edit Other available actions in the menu: Delete Row action: Edit\nRow action does not apply to columns with enable/disable actions.\nAdd a currency When the page is loaded, the currency symbol on the language list will be displayed with X.\nIf the merchant selects a currency from the drop list before, it will present the example with the right currency symbol with the CLDR settings (position and symbol, decimals, separating symbol by language).\nOn the second case for custom currency, the CLDR preconfigure the position and separating symbol by language until the merchant edit the symbol and the decimal. After it, the currency symbol edited will replace the “X”.\nA currency symbol position (right, left with or without space) saved for a language will be saved for all the currencies for the selected language.\nA wording is provided to explain that the format part changes will be applied for all the currencies.\nFormat setting on the bottom of the currency form. Pop-in after the click on edit when no symbol was filled. The merchant can reset the format of a language by clicking on the reset button next to the edit button.\nThe decimals and thousands separating format are defined by the CLDR, so for each language, the radio have an adapted the display. Any updates on the symbol input will update the 4 propositions on the radio button.\nBy clicking \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; on the popin, it will save the format currency and updates the language format table with the new format.\nEdit a currency All the inputs are full filled with saved data from the currency to be edited. So when the user edits the format, a pop-in will open in which the user can change the currency format. The symbol and its position on the price display can be edited with a text input for the symbol and through a radio button with 4 propositions:\n just in front of the amount, X999.99 in front with a space between the symbol and the amount, X 999.99 just after the amount, 999.99X after the amount with a space between them, 999.99 X  Pop-in full filled with the yen currency data. The decimals and thousands separating format are defined by the CLDR, so for each language, the radio has an adapted the display.

Therefore on the 1.7, it was removed to prepare the development of a bigger feature more complete.\nThe Unicode CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) is a database containing the convention of different languages as format date, currencies and more shared by the biggest companies. It will be the main source to provide the best currencies pre-configuration to the merchant.\nThese features allows the merchant to have all the currency (cryptocurrencies, local currencies\u0026hellip;) that he needs and responds to every customer\u0026rsquo;s expectation. The merchant just has to find right paiement module adapted to their new currency.\nSPECIFICATION The 1rst improvements features of the Page Add Currency and Edit Currency in Page Currencies of Localization Category allow:\n Add an official new currency from the CLDR or create a custom currency. Edit a currency (this is new in 1.7)  Add/Edit currency inputs:\n Currency name * (mandatory) Symbol * (mandatory) ISO code * (mandatory) Decimals Exchange rate (1.00 by default if it is an alternative currency)  The Symbol, Currency name, ISO code and Exchange rate are mandatory to save an official currency or a custom one.\nOLD SPECIFICATION  10058 11690  DETAILED SPECIFICATION Add a currency To add an currency, the user can choose from a drop list from our currency database (CDLR) or select the checkbox “Create new” to make a custom currency.\nChoosing a currency from the drop list will fill all the inputs automatically and make the ISO and the numeric iso code uneditable and greyed.\nIf the user edits the currency chosen in the drop list just before saving, the currency will be marked as “Edited” on the Currencies Page.(cf see the Currencies Page section)\nWhen creating a new currency, the iso numeric code field is hidden and it enables the code iso field if it was disabled. The user has to fill all the inputs by himself and choose a new unique ISO code.\nIf the user selects a currency from droplist but clicks on the new currency checkbox, the fields remain pre-filled but the droplist displays \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; instead of the selected currency.\nA warning is displayed, if the user choose to create his own currency by clicking on the checkbox and choose an already existing ISO code. The ISO code is an unique value used as the identification of the currency. The message warns the user that if he wants to use the currency (displays the currency name from the ISO code) from the ISO that he must select it from the droplist and if he still wants to create his own currency that he must find ISO code that is not used by any currencies.\nWarning wording: “Oops\u0026hellip; it looks like this ISO code already exists. If you are :\n  trying to create a new currency, you must type a different ISO code\n  trying to modify the %currency% currency, just go back to the list and edit it”\n(Admin.International.Notification)\n  Clicking on the save button, it saves the new currency and redirects to Currencies List. The cancel button redirects to Currencies List but doesn\u0026rsquo;t save the currency.\nEdit a currency After clicking on editing one of the currency in the list, the Edit Page is open with all the inputs already filled from the currency selected.\nAll the following fields can be edited:\n Currency name Currency Symbol ISO code (only for custom currencies) Decimals (2 by default ) Exchange rate (1 by default if it is an alternative currency)  Bellow the language listing, a reset button is available to put back the initial content of all the fields. The merchant has to accept the modal confirmation to restore the configuration. The button is hidden for custom currency.\nClicking on the save button, it saves the new currency and redirects to Currencies List. The cancel button redirects to Currencies List but does\u0026rsquo;nt save the currency.\nCurrencies Page On the Currencies Page, every edited currency will be marked as “edited” next to their name on the currencies list.\nWhen an alternative currency is added the icon user from material design next to the name to symbolize this currency was created by the merchant.\nNB: after the migration, the activation exchange rate is at the bottom of the list.\nDelete a currency If I delete a currency, the currency should be hidden from the BO\u0026rsquo;s currency list but it must be kept to display the orders made in the deleted currency. If no orders have been made with the currency, the currency can be definitely deleted.\nDESIGN https://invis.io/SAPYJZCCR6K#/338742836_Edit_Currency\nCASES Error/Warning case: Saving with an ISO code already existing in the database\nExchange rate update for the custom currencies, check if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply a default value\nISSUES RELATED  9714 10014 10017 10055 10054 10053 9885  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA To be completed with QA and developers.\nGiven\u0026hellip; [a context],\nwhen\u0026hellip; [users does something],\nthen\u0026hellip; [what the user should observe]\n"

	"content": "Specifications for Date of delivery module In 1.7, the dateofdelivery module has never been integrated with Classic Theme, which results in the module not being displayed in front-office (when using the $hookDisplayBeforeCarrier). This specification aims at redefining available features with this module so that it is easier to make it work on PrestaShop 1.7.\nFRONT-OFFICE This module displays an approximate date of delivery during the checkout process. It should be displayed in the \u0026ldquo;Shipping\u0026rdquo; section of the process, as shown on the mock up below. BACK-OFFICE The configuration page in BO has two sections:\n  Carrier configuration. The module relies on indications from your carriers. You must therefore add rules for each of your carriers, by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Add a new carrier rule\u0026rdquo; link.\n  Settings:\n Extra time when a product is out of stock. Estimate the time it might take for your team to re-stock products. This is only useful if customers can order out-of-stock products (the option for this is in the \u0026ldquo;Products\u0026rdquo; preference page, in the \u0026ldquo;Products stock\u0026rdquo; section). Extra time for preparation of the order. Estimate the time it might take for your team to prepare an order. Preparation option. If your packaging team also works on weekends, indicate it, as the module takes this into account. Date format. The format in which the expected delivery date is displayed. It uses PHP date() format: each letter has a meaning, as explained in the indicated link. The default, \u0026ldquo;l j F Y\u0026rdquo;, means the date will be displayed in the format \u0026ldquo;Saturday 21 January 2012\u0026rdquo;. There are many more parameters that you can use to build the date format as you see fit: see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php.    Adding a new carrier rule is pretty straightforward:\n Carrier. Choose the carrier for which you want to add the rule. If the wanted carrier is not there, you must create it in the Shipping \u0026gt; Carriers page. Delivery between. Set the timeframe in which the chosen carrier promises to deliver products. You have to gather this information from the carrier itself. Preparation options. Some carriers also prepare their packages on weekend days, so as to send them first thing on Monday morning. Be sure to indicate it if so.  You should create as many carrier rules as necessary.\n"

	"content": "SPECIFICATIONS - ECOTAX WHAT IS THE ECOTAX The ecotax is a contribution in France to finance the collect, the recycling and the depollution of a piece of furniture or used electrical and electronic equipment. The ecotax is not a tax per se, but a fixed mandatory contribution (the actual term is \u0026ldquo;eco-participation\u0026rdquo;) that must be paid by the customer. Then it’s donated by the seller to a collection agency.\nThe amount of the ecotax is fixed and does not depend on the product price. The ecotax is subject to VAT.\nWHERE IS THE ECOTAX IN PRESTASHOP The ecotax can be toggled in the \u0026ldquo;Tax Options\u0026rdquo; section from the International \u0026gt; Taxes page. Once enabled, a new drop-down is displayed containing all the tax rules, allowing the merchant to choose the VAT rate that will be applied on the ecotax. But this drop-down should rather be displayed on the product page (instead of International \u0026gt; Taxes page) as the ecotax VAT rate should be same as the VAT product rate (see improvement #22827). If the ecotax is enabled, then a field \u0026ldquo;Ecotax (tax incl.)\u0026rdquo; is displayed in the Back Office\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;add / edit product\u0026rdquo; page, so that the merchant can input the amount of included ecotax (tax included) in the product\u0026rsquo;s price. However, ecotax only applies for physical products, so it should never be displayed for virtual products.\nIf the ecotax is filled in the back-office for a product, then it\u0026rsquo;s displayed in the front-office product page under the product price: “Including €X.XX for ecotax”.\nHOW DOES THE ECOTAX WORK The ecotax is already included in the product\u0026rsquo;s price, tax excluded. The ecotax field in the product page exists exclusively to provide information about the amount of ecotax that is already included in the product\u0026rsquo;s price.\nThe ecotax is provided for information purposes and does not affect the final price because it is already included in it.\nThe ecotax is subject to VAT at the same rate applicable to the product.\nThe ecotax amount has to be paid in full by the customer and can never be reduced. The ecotax (and its VAT amount if applicable) must also be displayed and paid in the case of a gift product.\nExample Product price tax excl with ecotax: 10€\nVAT 20% = 2€\nProduct price tax incl with ecotax: 12€\n As you can see, the ecotax is already included in the price, so it has no impact in the calculation.\n Ecotax tax excl: 2€\nEcotax VAT 20% = 0,40€\nEcotax tax incl: 2,40€\nVAT paid by the merchant: 1,6 + 0,40 = 2,00€\nEcotax paid by the merchant: 2€\nEarnings for the merchant: 12 - (2,00 + 2) = 8,00€\nIf there is a discount, it should be applied on the product price ecotax excluded Considering the following informations:\nA - Produt price tax incl with ecotax: 12€\nB - Ecotax tax incl: 2,40€\nC - Rebate: 90%\nThe final price will be: C * (A - B) + B = 0,1 * (12 - 2,40) + 2,40 = 3,36€\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "ps_facetedsearch specifications The faceted navigation displays a block with different criteria available to filter the products, mostly attributes, features, and price ranges. It is very handy to help the customers easily find a product.\nThis module has been massively reworked and keeps evolving frequently. This master issue (EPIC) allows to track the status of the module and follow its improvements : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9684\nIntroduction\nThe module displays a block on category pages with layered navigation filters. Layered navigation enables the customer to define cumulative criteria to filter category products, little by little providing more details in order to reduce the number of displayed products. This is a great tool for customers who know the details of what they want (color, condition, price range\u0026hellip;), but are unsure how to find it.\nWhen configuring the module, you are presented with 4 sections:\n- Index and caches : this module heavily relies on database index and its own content cache.\n- Existing filter templates : A filter template is the kind of navigation to which the customer has access to.\n- Build your own filter template : You can build various templates, which will serve as the basis for what the customer sees.\n- Configuration : You can further detail the way this module operates.\nIndexes and caches In order to work properly, layered navigation needs to be kept up-to-date with your latest products, product attributes and product prices – unless these never change. You should therefore regularly re-index the data, using the buttons provided here. They each have specific actions:\n Index all missing prices. Only adds to the index the prices that were not indexed before. Much faster than the next button. Rebuild entire price index. Adds to the index all the prices, whether they were already indexed before or not. Much slower than the previous button when you have many products. Build attribute index. Adds to the index all the product attributes. Build url index. Adds to the index the URLs for all the products. You should update your indexes every time your products' data changes. As this can prove pretty painstaking or even boring, PrestaShop enables you to trigger the indexing automatically, using cron tasks. Add the provided URLs to your crontab, and you will not have to handle this yourself anymore. If you do not know about cron and crontab, ask your webhost about it.  Existing filters templates Layered navigation is based on templates, or groups of criteria. There is one by default, named \u0026ldquo;My template\u0026rdquo;, which makes use of all the available filters. You should create templates more adapted to your content or needs.\nYou can have as many templates as needed. This section enables you to edit and delete them when necessary.\nBuild your own filters template The template builder enables you to specify what kind of filters your customers should have access to.\nCreating a new template requires only three easy steps:\n Select categories. You can either create filter for the whole site, or on a per-category basis. You could for instance have the whole site display the price filter, while some categories can have additional filters. When choosing \u0026ldquo;Specific categories\u0026rdquo;, a small window opens where you can choose in which categories this filter should be available. Note that filters do not automatically apply to sub-categories of the selected category: if there is no product on your \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; category, then the layered navigation will not appear there. Selected filters. The number of available filters depends on the content of your shop. Six default filters will appear here: price, weight, condition, manufacturer, available stock and sub-categories. Along with these are the attribute groups for all products in the selected categories (with the number of products). Check a filter\u0026rsquo;s box to move if from the \u0026ldquo;Available\u0026rdquo; section to the \u0026ldquo;Selected\u0026rdquo; one. You can move the filters up and down with your mouse cursor, which will influence their display in the front-page. Each filter has a two drop-down menu included:   Type of display. You can choose how the filter is displayed to the customer. The visualization depends on the type of the filter.   Numerical (price \u0026amp; weight): check-box, radio button, drop-down list. Note that only the check-box setting allows for multiple selection. Alphabetical (all others): slider, inputs area, list of values.  The checkbox allows to select several filters, while radio button and dropdown list only allow one choice.\nLimit. If some of your categories have too many choices for a given filters, you can limit the number of displayed items using this selector.   Name your template. Customers will not see the name, but it will prove very useful to you when you have to edit one template among the dozen or hundred you may create in the lifespan of your shop. Note that saving the filter will not save the whole configuration: you have to save the filter first, then click on \u0026ldquo;Save configuration\u0026rdquo;.  Configuration Several options are available:\n Hide filter values with no product is matching. If disabled, you will still see filters, even if they are useless because of the lack of matching product (which can make the layered navigation over-crowded with options). Show the number of matching products. Displays the number after the name of the filter, between brackets. If there is no matching product, it will display \u0026ldquo;(0)\u0026rdquo;. Show products from subcategories. The filter applies to more than just the current category. Category filter depth (0 for no limits, 1 by default). If the above option is enabled, you risk having too many products taken into account, and lose the interest of layered navigation. The depth is of 1 by default, but you can use even deeper sub-categories. Use tax to filter price. Allow indexing robots (google, yahoo, bing, \u0026hellip;) to use condition/availability/manufacturer filter. These four filters help you define whether search bots should be able to browse your navigation and index it. This can prove beneficial for SEO (search engine optimization). These options apply to all templates and filters.  Availability options\nThere are 3 options in the module configuration when the availability filter is enabled:\n Display in stock products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO “In stock”: Product quantity \u0026gt; 0\nBy default it should be on Yes\n Display available products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO “Available”: Product quantity \u0026lt;= 0 \u0026amp; available for order\nBy default it should be on Yes\n Display out of stock products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO “Out of stock”: Product quantity \u0026lt;= 0 \u0026amp; not available for order\nBy default it should be on No\nThese 3 options should also be displayed when the availability filter is disabled:\n Display in stock products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO products with quantity \u0026gt; 0\nShould be on Yes by default\n Display available products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO products with quantity \u0026lt;= 0 but available for order\nShould be on Yes by default\n Display out of stock products: Yes / No  If the option is set to Yes, display in FO products with quantity \u0026lt;= 0 but not available for order\nShould be on No by default\nHide filter values when no product is matching option\nIf the option is set to Yes, then filters are hided when no products are matching\nBy default it should be on Yes\nExample, you have following filters\nMaterial\nSteel\nGlass\nSteel look\nPolished\nBrushed\nGlass look\nNice\nUgly\nDesired behavior\nYou select Steel - Filter Glass look should get hidden.\nYou select Glass - Filter Steel look should get hidden.\nYou select Nice or Ugly - Steel option should get hidden.\nYou select Polished or Brushed - Glass option should get hidden.\nSorting of brands in front-office\nIn front-office, if brands starts with a character, so sort by ascending alphabetical order.\nIn front-office, if brands starts with number, so sort by increasing number and ignore other characters after number.\nIf the merchant selected a filter number limit, so show the X filters with the most results and sort them by ascending alphabetical order or increasing number.\nExample, in brackets the number of result:\nSize\n38 (50)\n40 (20)\n42 (100)\nSize\n10 cm (50)\n30 cm (20)\n40 cm (100)\nBrands\nAdidas (291)\nConverses (625)\nNike (406)\nSorting of attributes values in front-office\nIn front-office, attributes values are sorted by position ascending like defined in the back-office\nIf the merchant selected a filter number limit, so show the X filters with the most results and sort them by ascending position.\nSorting of features values in front-office\nIn front-office, if features values starts with a character, so sort by ascending alphabetical order.\nIn front-office, if features values starts with number, so sort by increasing number and ignore other characters after number.\nIf the merchant selected a filter number limit, so show the X filters with the most results and sort them by ascending alphabetical order or increasing number.\nExample, in brackets the number of result:\nSize\n1,6 (50)\n10 (20)\n11,2 (100)\nSize\n10 cm (50)\n30 cm (20)\n40 cm(100)\nSleeves\nShort sleeves (291)\nLong sleeves (406)\nWithout sleeves (625)\nDisplay of attribute group in front-office\nWhen you create an attribute in back-office, you have to fill the name and the public name. As a customer, in front-office I want to see the public name of the attribute group.\n"

If the user goes to another page and back to this one, the notification is displayed again.\nGroups listing As usual, four tables options are displayed on the top-right hand corner as icons:\n Add new\n Refresh list\n Show SQL query\n Export to SQL manager\n  By default, the table is divided into the following columns:\n ID\n Group name\n Discount (%)\n Members\n Show prices\n Creation date\n  To allow users to narrow down their search, searching and/or sorting options are available according to the columns:\nInput searching fields are available for ID, Group name, Discount (%), Members Drop-down with 2 selectable options (Yes, No) is available for Show prices column Date pickers (From and to) are available for Creation date column Sorting ASC \u0026amp; DESC are available for ID, Group name, Discount (%), Members and Creation date columns\nAt the beginning of each line is a checkbox while, at the end of each line, 3 actions can be done: Edit, View, and Delete. The main action is Edit. The View action can be performed by clicking on the line. Checkboxes play with the \u0026lsquo;Bulk actions\u0026rsquo; selector that allows either to \u0026lsquo;Select all\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Unselect all\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;Delete selected\u0026rsquo;.\nPrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s 3 default groups cannot be deleted so they have no checkbox nor Delete actions.\nDefault groups options Users can select which group designates the 3 following customers profiles:\nVisitors group. By default, it is \u0026lsquo;Visitor\u0026rsquo; but merchants can use the dropdown selector to choose any group. A tooltip is available: The group defined for your un-identified visitors. in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nGuests group. By default, it is \u0026lsquo;Guest\u0026rsquo; but merchants can use the dropdown selector to choose any group. A tooltip is available: The group defined for your identified guest customers (used in guest checkout). in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nCustomers group.

A tooltip is available: The group defined for your identified registered customers. in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nUsers should click \u0026lsquo;Save\u0026rsquo; to update their default groups' settings. If all settings are properly saved, then a successful message is displayed: The settings have been successfully updated. in Admin.Notifications.Success.\nMultistore behavior Specific shop or group context In a specific shop context or in a group context, the options listed above should have checkboxes.\nAll shops context In an all shops context, the options listed above should have specific settings drop-down.\n:point_right: Multistore general specs\nAdd form Clicking \u0026lsquo;Add new group\u0026rsquo; redirects to a form.\nName. Users must type the name of the customers group. By default, it is limited to 32 characters. If the merchant tries to save a name exceeding this number, then he should stay on this page and get an error notification right below the field: This field cannot be longer than %limit% characters (incl. HTML tags). in Admin.Notifications.Error.\nA help text is available: Invalid characters: in Admin.Shopparameters.Help. It applies to the following characters, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;={}. If the input contains one of those specific characters, an error notification is displayed: The %s field is invalid. in Admin.Notifications.Error.\nA drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are displayed in the drop-down). It allows choosing in which language the field is displayed and customizing the title according to the customer\u0026rsquo;s language.\nDiscount. With this option, merchants can set a discount for all group members. A discount in the context of a customers group is expected to apply to all the store\u0026rsquo;s catalog. It directly impacts the price and lowers it. A help text is available: Automatically apply this value as a discount on all products for members of this customer group. in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nOnly numbers can be typed in the field. If the merchant tries to save letters or a negative value, then he should stay on this page and get an error notification right below the field: The discount value is incorrect (must be a percentage). in Admin.Shopparameters.Notification.\nPrice display method. A drop-down selector allows users to create a group of customers who can buy products with (\u0026lsquo;Tax included\u0026rsquo;) or without taxes (\u0026lsquo;Tax excluded\u0026rsquo;). By default, prices are displayed tax included. A help text is available: How prices are displayed in the order summary for this customer group. in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nShow prices. By default, all customers can view the prices. If set to \u0026lsquo;No\u0026rsquo;, it activates the catalog mode for this group of customers: they should not be able to get the prices when browsing the front office nor have any shopping cart. It also impacts the customer account on the front office, turning off the \u0026lsquo;Order history and details\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Credit slips\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;Merchandise returns\u0026rsquo; pages. A help text is available: Need to hide prices for all groups? Save time, enable catalog mode in Product Settings instead. in Admin.Shopparameters.Help.\nShop association. The shop association block is displayed when the multistore is enabled and if several shops are configured.\n:point_right: Shop association block specs\nEdit form Users can also set per-category and per-module settings. Once the customers group saved, clicking \u0026lsquo;Edit\u0026rsquo; in the groups listing should load the same form with 2 extra options:\nCategory discount Merchants can set a discount per-category for this given group of customers. Clicking \u0026lsquo;Add a category discount\u0026rsquo; displays a modal window entitled \u0026lsquo;New group category discount\u0026rsquo; that shows the categories arborescence of the shop, clickable through radio buttons. Only one category can be selected.\nTwo buttons at the top right-hand corner allow to \u0026lsquo;Expand all\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Collapse all\u0026rsquo;. Clicking on \u0026lsquo;Expand all\u0026rsquo; deploys all categories and subcategories and turns this button into \u0026lsquo;Collapse all\u0026rsquo;. Clicking \u0026lsquo;Collapse all\u0026rsquo; displays only the parent category, \u0026lsquo;Home\u0026rsquo; by default.\nOnly products that have the selected category (or any subcategory of the selected category) as their default category should be affected by the discount. The expected behavior of a category discount works as followed: it prevails over any discount a member of this group could benefit from in this category. See notifications below.\nAn information notification id displayed: Caution: The discount applied to a category does not stack with the overall reduction but instead replaces it. in Admin.Shopparameters.Notification. Right below is a warning notification displayed: Only products that have this category as the default category will be affected. in Admin.Shopparameters.Notification.\nDiscount (%). Only numbers can be typed in the field. If the merchant tries to save letters or a negative value, then he should stay on this modal window and get an error notification right below the field: The discount value is incorrect (must be a percentage). in Admin.Shopparameters.Notification.\nClicking \u0026lsquo;Add\u0026rsquo; saves preferences. It displays the category discount(s) in the \u0026lsquo;Edit\u0026rsquo; form, just below the \u0026lsquo;Category discount\u0026rsquo; field, with the following information: route to the category, discount value, and a \u0026lsquo;Delete\u0026rsquo; button. If a user deletes a discount, the line simply disappears. Clicking on the close icon or anywhere outside the modal cancels the action.\nAuthorized modules With this setting, merchants can authorize or prevent members of this group to access and use some of the shop\u0026rsquo;s modules. A list of all the store\u0026rsquo;s installed modules is displayed with a switch button to enable or disable each module. By default, all modules are enabled.\nTwo actions are available at the end of the page: Save and Cancel. When saving, the user gets redirected to the Shop Parameters \u0026gt; Customer Settings \u0026gt; Groups page with a success notification: Update successful in Admin.Notifications.Success.\nView form A summary of the preferences set for a customers group is accessible through the \u0026lsquo;View\u0026rsquo; action or just by clicking on the line in the groups listing. It opens a new page divided into three parts:\nGroup information Merchants can find all settings in this part:\n Name of the group of customers\n Discount\n Price display method\n Show prices  Current category discount A warning notification, None, is displayed by default if the customers group has no category discount. If there is one or several, it takes the form of a listing displaying the following information:\n Category\n Discount  Members of this customer group A wording is supposed to explicit how group members are displayed: Limited to the first 100 customers. and Please use filters to narrow your search. in Admin.Shopparameters.Feature. As usual, four tables options are displayed on the top-right hand corner as icons:\n  Refresh list\n  Show SQL query\n  Export to SQL manager\nBy default, the table is divided into the following columns:\n  ID\n  Social title\n  First name\n  Last name\n  Email address\n  Date of birth\n  Registration date\n  Enabled\n  To allow users to narrow down their search, searching and/or sorting options are available according to the columns:\nInput searching fields are available for ID, Social title, First name, Last name and Email address columns Date pickers are available (from and to) for Date of birth and Registration date columns Sorting ASC \u0026amp; DESC are available for ID, Social title, First name, Last name, Email address, Date of birth and registration date columns\nAt the beginning of each line is a checkbox while, at the end of each line, an \u0026lsquo;Edit\u0026rsquo; button can be clicked, redirecting to the Customer dedicated page in the Customers \u0026gt; Customers section of the back office. Checkboxes play with the \u0026lsquo;Bulk actions\u0026rsquo; selector that allows either to \u0026lsquo;Select all\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Unselect all\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Enable selection\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;Disable selection\u0026rsquo;.\nA \u0026lsquo;Back to list\u0026rsquo; button is available at the end of the page for merchants to go back to the Shop Parameters \u0026gt; Customer Settings \u0026gt; Groups page.\n"

	"content": "SPECIFICATIONS - IMAGE FILE FORMATS As a merchant, I want to be able to use the best web suitable images on my store, such as .png, .svg, or .webp.\nIntroduction Several issues have been brought to our attention on GitHub, especially on the need for PrestaShop to support more image formats. Indeed, images have great business value for online stores and their formats have quite evolved since the release of PrestaShop 1.7.\nSo it is time for us to define the image formats we want to support and take this opportunity to specify behaviors! Goal here is to add missing useful formats, not to remove already supported ones to avoid breaking changes.\n:point_right: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18518\nContext In the core of PrestaShop, image formats that are currently supported are: .gif, .jpg, .jpeg and .png. All formats supported are mentioned in the ImageManager file, and defined by MIME / Library GD.\nGD support theses formats: https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php\nWhat defines an image format? Both its MIME type and its extension are checked because GD needs a correct MIME type and the extension is needed for a correct URL. A MIME type represents a file type - you can put any extension in any file type.\nImages are uploaded right where they need to appear, on the page concerned, they are not handled by any media center accessible in the back office.\nPrestaShop Below is the list of the BO pages where images can be uploaded:\n  Brands\n  Categories\n  Files\n  Products\n  Stores\n  Suppliers\n  Header logo\n  Mail / Invoice logo\n  Favicon\n  As for modules, images are requested for:\n Banner Image Slider Block Reassurance  Regarding the FO, images can be uploaded though:\n Contact form Customized product page  Add SVG \u0026amp; WEBP support Back office \u0026amp; modules SVG. Decision has been made to first focus on all images upload available in the back office, except for the favicon and the email logos in the Design \u0026gt; Theme \u0026amp; Logo page.\nFavicons are a specific case using precise image formats and it should be addressed later. And the email support for SVG format is too limited for now.\nWEBP. Decision has been made to first focus on all images upload available in the back office, except for the favicon, the email, and the invoice logos in the Design \u0026gt; Theme \u0026amp; Logo page.\nFavicons are a specific case using precise image formats and it should be addressed later. Same for the email and PDF documents that do not enough support WebP images for now.\nFront office Customers can upload images in two places in the front office: in the contact form and on a customized product page. Images formats allowed are: .png, .jpg, and .gif. Expected behavior should be to add the .svg format to this list since one of its great advantages is that it allows resizing with limited loss of quality.\nAs for the .webp format, it does not seem very relevant to add it to this list. Indeed, the use case is not adapted to poor email support nor prone to improving performance.\n"

If the user selects a country that is already imported, it will update all localizations content selected.  Localization pack you want to import\nThe Localization pack you want to import droplist displays a list of countries when clicking on it. It can be selected by:\n Searching the list via the search input field by typing the complete country name or part of it (at least one word). Scrolling down the list and find the country - sorted by name (A-Z).  Content to import\nThe contents to import are listed as check-boxes to be selected:\n States (checked by default) Taxes (checked by default) Currencies (checked by default) Languages (checked by default) Units (e.g. weight, volume, distance) (checked by default) Change the behavior of the price display for groups (un-checked by default) Checking this content affects the display of prices on both the back office (back-office/international/locations/Countries.md, back-office/shop-parameters/customer-settings/groups.md) and the front office (front-office/product-page.md, front-office/products/list.md, front-office/Discounts). This option will override the default behavior for the selected country if you already have it inside the shop.  Download pack data\nThe Download pack data toggle displays a YES/NO toggle button which is set to \u0026lsquo;YES\u0026rsquo; by default. If \u0026lsquo;YES\u0026rsquo; is set, the localizations that are selected on \u0026lsquo;Content to import\u0026rsquo; section will be downloaded from prestashop.com CLDR directory and override the local CLDR localizations. If set to \u0026lsquo;NO\u0026rsquo; it will use the local CLDR localizations (localization/CLDR/core/common/main/country-code.xml, localization/CLDR/core/common/main/country-code_COUNTRY-ISO-CODE.xml). The local CLDR localizations can be modified manually by modifying the local files mentioned.\nAfter any modifications applied to local CLDR files, the PrestaShop cache (back-office/advanced-parameters/performance/clear-cache.md) must be cleared to be shown.\nImport\nPressing the Import button applies the \u0026lsquo;Import a localization pack\u0026rsquo; options. Clicking on it might affect both FrontOffice and BackOffice or change the default price behaviors based on options chose from \u0026lsquo;Content to import\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Download pack data\u0026rsquo; fields.\nMultistore behavior States will be imported for all shops, no matter the context selected. Taxes will be imported for all shops, no matter the context selected. Taxes rules will be imported for the selected shop(s) in the context. Currencies will be imported for the selected shop(s) in the context. Languages will be imported for all shops, no matter the context selected.\nConfiguration Using this section will give the user the ability to change default localization configuration such as default langiage, country, and currency. Changing this configuration will override the default behaviours.\nDefault language\nThe Default language droplist displays the languages that are already imported to the shop by the user from \u0026lsquo;Content to import\u0026rsquo; section. By default, it shows the language the user has defined during the PrestaShop installation process. Changing it will change the language that is selected by default on the front office.\nSet language from browser\nThe Set language from browser toggle displays a \u0026lsquo;YES/NO\u0026rsquo; toggle button which is set to \u0026lsquo;YES\u0026rsquo; by default.

The main uses cases of the mutistore are:\n B2B/B2C shop, international shop (many languages, many currencies), several brands  WHAT Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour to setup many stores\nSPECIFICATIONS Enable the multistore The multistore is disabled by default and can be enabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; General  Once enabled, a new \u0026ldquo;Multistore\u0026rdquo; menu is displayed in Advanced parameters \u0026gt; Multistore  There are two types of main actions in this page :\n create a group of shops - to be able to share certain characteristics between the shops in that group and to manage a set of shops as easily as you would a single shop, while still being able to fine-tune the details of each shop manually. create a new shop - to be able to have different shops administered by the same back office  Shop group A shop group can contain many stores.  By default there is a \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; group and it contains the default shop (the one created when PrestaShop was installed)  But the default shop can be changed when there is more than one shop.\nWhen a shop group is created, many fields are displayed:\n Shop group name Shop group color: colorpicker only from 1.7.8 There is tooltip for this colorpicker: ‘Choose a color with the color picker, or enter an HTML color (e.g. \u0026ldquo;lightblue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;#CC6600\u0026rdquo;).’ in Admin.Catalog.Help  \u0026ldquo;It will only be applied to this group of shops, each store keeps its individual color.\u0026rdquo; Share customers: Yes / No  Once this option is enabled, the shops in this group will share customers.  If a customer registers in any one of these shops, the account will automatically be available in the others shops of this group. This option can\u0026rsquo;t be disabled once customers are registered. Share available quantities to sell: Yes / No  This option allows to share available quantities between shops of this group.  When changing this option, all available products quantities will be reset to 0. Share orders: Yes / No  Once this option is enabled (which is only possible if customers and available quantities are shared among shops), the customer\u0026rsquo;s cart and orders will be shared by all shops in this group. This way, any purchase started in one shop will be able to be completed in another shop from the same group.  Once logged in, the customer will be able to see his orders in another shop from the same group.  This option can\u0026rsquo;t be disabled once orders are made. If this option is disabled, the customer will not be able to see the carts and the orders created in a shop from another shop. Status: Yes / No  To enable or disable the shop group.  Shop A shop must be in a group and can only be in one group.\nWhen a shop is created, many fields are displayed:\n Shop name  Please note, you cannot have 2 stores with the same name in the same store group. If you try to do this when you save, an error will be displayed: \u0026quot; You cannot have 2 stores with the same name in the same store group.\u0026quot;\n Shop color: colorpicker only from 1.7.8  There is tooltip for this colorpicker: \u0026ldquo;Choose a color with the color picker, or enter an HTML color (e.g. \u0026ldquo;lightblue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;#CC6600\u0026rdquo;)’ in Admin.Catalog.Help \u0026ldquo;It will be applied to the multistore header to underline your shop context.\u0026rdquo; Shop group: Allow to select the shop group of the shop Category root: Allow to select the root category of the shop. Associated categories: The root category selected above is displayed + the sub-categories belonging to the root category selected. It allows to select the categories that will be associated with the store  Theme: Allow to select the front-office theme of the store among the themes available in the back office  When a shop is created, data can be imported:\n Import data: Yes / No  Allow to choose if you want to import data from another shop or not Choose the source shop: Allow to choose the shop from which the data will be imported Choose data to import: Select the data to import  URL A shop must have at least one URL and can have many URLs but only one main URL.  All URLs set for a shop will be redirected to the main URL. \nTo add a URL to a shop, select the shop in the \u0026ldquo;Multistore tree\u0026rdquo; selector, and then click on the \u0026ldquo;Add new URL\u0026rdquo; button. PrestaShop will load a screen with two sections and eight options:\n  Shop: A reminder of the shop to which you are adding a URL. You may also simply switch to another shop.\n  Main URL. By enabling this, you indicate that you want all the other URLs for this shop to redirect to this main URL (this will swtch any other main URL to be a normal URL).\n  Status: You can disable and enable a URL at any time.\n  Domain: The shop\u0026rsquo;s domain name itself. It does not have to be limited to the domain name: you can indicate a sub-domain if you need to. Just make sure to not add \u0026lsquo;http://\u0026rsquo;, or any \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo;. Example: www.example.com or kids.example.com.\n  Domain SSL: If your SSL domain is different from your main domain, be sure to indicate it in that field. Example: www.example.com or kids.example.com.\n  Physical URL: Here you must set the physical path to your actual installation on your server. If the shop is at the root of the domain or subdomain, leave this field empty. Example: / or /kids/.\n  Virtual URL: You can make the shop transparently available to customers using this option: through the power of URL rewriting, you can have your shop be displayed without the need to create a sub-folder. Of course, URL rewriting must be enabled in PrestaShop (meaning Friendly URLs, see the \u0026ldquo;SEO \u0026amp; URLs\u0026rdquo; page of the \u0026ldquo;Traffic\u0026rdquo; menu, in \u0026ldquo;Shop Parameters\u0026rdquo;). Example: /shoes/. Note that this only works for subfolder shops, not subdomain shops.\n  Final URL: Gives you the impact that your URL settings above will have on the complete web address to your shop.\n  "

By default the value is #ffffff. If the form is submited without color, then the status name isn\u0026rsquo;t visible (see issue #21284)  The order return status can be displayed on:\n the Order Follow page in Front Office customer account, the Order View page in Back-Office on merchandise return tab, the Merchandise Returns List Page, the Merchandise Returns Edit Page.  Adding new return status will add new return status on the Merchandise Returns Edit Page return status droplist.\nNote that it is not possible to delete default return statuses such as Waiting for confirmation, Package received, etc. These PrestaShop return statuses can only be modified.\nMultistore behavior As the Add/Edit form does not display any shop association block, when merchants add or edit an order return status, it is added to all shops or edited for all shops - no matter the context selected.\nAn information message should be displayed at the top of the page to inform the user of this behavior: \u0026ldquo;Note that this feature is available in all shops context only. It will be added to all your stores.\u0026rdquo; (See issue #19497)\nSo all order status should be displayed in the listing, be it an all shops, a group, or a specific shop context.\n:point_right: Read multistore specials cases\nSpecific cases When deleting an order status or a return status, there is currently no check on the order database, to ensure that there is no order currently using this status. This can provoke errors and exceptions (as described on the following issue : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/19098), on several pages :\n the order history page in FO (exception) the Order detail page in BO (exception) the order listing page in BO (no exception, but the status is not displayed) the customer page  To prevent this situation, an improvement has been introduced (178 version) changing the order status hard delete into a soft delete, setting the \u0026ldquo;deleted\u0026rdquo; value to 1, so that the status can be retrieved in DB even after it has been deleted, preventing orders having this status to break.\nFor order listing and detail pages in B0, this means that when a user deletes a previously created order or return status, it will :\n flag the order status as deleted (soft delete) meaning that it will no longer be visible in the order statuses list but will still be available in database For orders with this status as their current status : leave it visible in the order status droplist (with (deleted) displayed) until another one is selected once another one is selected, remove it from the droplist so that it cannot be chosen or seen anymore  For the order history page in FO, it will stay transparent for the user, as the deleted status will still be displayed in the customer\u0026rsquo;s order history.\nFor the customer page, this improvement fixes the exception while having no other impact on the page.\nMISSING PART OF SPECIFICATIONS TO BE COMPLETED  Errors messages - In which cases there should be an error message ? Multilanguage - Which fields are multilingual ? Permissions - What should happen if I don’t have view, add, edit, delete right ?

	"content": "Price calculation specifications Introduction\nThis document aims at explaining in details how product and order prices should be calculated in every shop scenarios.\nThis is a legal requirement, especially as it has an impact on invoices, so we must ensure prices are correctly calculated on PrestaShop websites.\nPrices have impact on products, orders, but also on discounts, invoices, etc. so this document details the different behaviours for all pages according to the shop scenario.\nContext - the problem In PrestaShop, we store prices with 6 digits in order to have computations as accurate as possible, especially when applying discounts or tax rates where it is necessary to have more digits than what is stored (= for EUR, 2 digits are used so for accurate computations, more than 2 digits are needed)\nThe topic is about about tax amounts.\nTax incl. price = (tax excl. price ) x (tax rate) Or Tax incl. price = (tax excl. price ) + (tax amount)\nWhen we need to display this tax amount, usually in PrestaShop we compute it by doing a substraction of tax incl. price minus tax excl. price .\nThe issue could arise when rounding is involved.\nSee the following situation:\n   usecase tax incl. price tax excl. tax amount     stored in database, with 6 digits A1 A2 A3   rounded for use B1 B2 B3   displayed C1 C2 C3      \u0026ldquo;Stored in database\u0026rdquo; is self-explanatory. In this line, A3 = A1 - A2\n  \u0026ldquo;Rounded for use\u0026rdquo;: let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to send a payment gateway the data it needs, we are going to send at least B1 and B2, maybe B3 too. If the customer pays in EUR, we are going to use the numbers stored in database and round them to 2 digits.\n  \u0026ldquo;Displayed\u0026rdquo;: in PrestaShop we display these numbers to customers and merchants after rounding them for the currency used to display (for example in the invoice)\n  The issues could arise if, in the source code, we compute C3 = C1 - C2 but B3 = ps_round(A3)\n@atomiix found at least 1 location in the code where this problem arises\nThe idea behind is that the rounded tax amount can be computed by 2 different ways:\n by substracting tax incl. by tax excl. or by rounding the stored tax amount  If the 2 numbers obtained by these 2 methods differ, then it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the customer pays a tax amount different from what he was displayed (although very close, and probably accurate).\nSpecifications\nDifferent rules are to be specified according to the chosen rounding option. This can be changed in the back office, in Shop Parameters \u0026gt; General. Merchants can choose both round mode (round up/down away from zero, when it\u0026rsquo;s half way there / round down the next even/odd value / round up/down to the nearest value) and round type (round on each item, round on each line, round on the total). Only changes in rounding type will have an impact on how price should be calculated.\n Generic rule - with round on each line type (default mode)  Most shops sell and display their products with taxes. This rule applies to these shop scenarios.\nProduct price is calculated based on the price indicated by the merchant and the tax that is applied to the product. The merchant can either modify the product price without tax, or the product price with tax included. This will impact the other field by doing an automatic calculation.\nFor instance, if the merchant sells a product with a price at 19,99€ tax included, the tax being 20%, then the product price without tax will be automatically calculated and will display \u0026ldquo;16.658333€\u0026rdquo; in the dedicated field. On the opposite, if the merchant decides to define the product price without tax at \u0026ldquo;12,69€\u0026rdquo;, then the product price tax included will be automatically calculated and will display \u0026ldquo;15.228€\u0026rdquo; in the dedicated field.\nOn front office, the prices are usually not displayed with more than 2 decimals, so a rounding is done according to the rounding configuration done on the website (Shop Parameters \u0026gt; General). This allows the merchant to display its product price with the expected format while being the closest price to the chosen one in the back office. But on some situations, there might be issues with sums and roundings. For instance, if :\n two products are included in the order - one is sold at 10€ tax excluded with a 20% tax and the other one is sold at 10.55€ tax excluded with a 2.10% tax the order benefits from a 3% discount \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; this results in : a total price of 19,93€ without tax included a final price of 22,088404€ tax included (on the website the rounded value displayed is 22,09€) and a tax value of 2,154904€ being rounded to 2,15€.  The problems happens when these 2 values are rounded as 9,93 + 2,15 = 22,08 and not 22,09€ resulting in a 1 cent difference. There\u0026rsquo;s a mistake here which makes the invoice incorrect (as all rounded values are displayed on it).\nTo prevent that, the solution is to start with the price tax excluded, then add the tax value (according to its percentage value). If the tax value contains more than 2 decimals, it should then be rounded according to the rounding configuration of the store. Once the product price without tax and the tax value are defined, it is easy to get the final price with tax included by suming the price without tax and the tax value. This will ensure the addition available on the invoice is always correct no matter how complex is the order.\nSpecific rule - with round on each item type  If taxes are not used, the unit price tax excluded of each product is rounded before making calculations.\nIf taxes are used, the unit price tax included of each product is rounded before making calculations.\n"

	"content": "Managing product images in front-office Current context In 1.7.7, it has been decided to introduce a change in behaviour in product thumbnails following a topwatchers issue : [#12241] (https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/12241). To ensure this change did not impact developers' modules, we have also let the possibility to override the image used as cover. The following specs aim at detailing what are the different behaviours, in back-office and front office listings and product pages.\n1/ Behaviour in BO When creating a “simple” product in back-office, it is possible to add images and define a cover image (which is the default / main image of the product). This cover image is :\n automatically assigned for products with only one photo editable thanks to an option to change it when the product has several photos attached to it  When creating a product with combinations, it is possible to distinguish photos related to the product and photos related to a specific combination. For instance, if a merchant adds 4 photos to his product and then creates a combination, he has several options :\n Select no photo (among the 4 uploaded photos) Select one photo (among the 4 uploaded photos) Select several photos (among the 4 uploaded photos)  Product \u0026gt; Combinations \u0026gt; Edit\nAccording to the chosen option, there will be differences in images displayed on front-office, on product listings and product pages.\nThe following paragraph aims at detailing all different scenarios.\n2/ Front-office product listing\n  For a simple product with no combination, the product cover image will always be displayed in product listings.\n  For a product with combinations, product listings will display the product cover image by default.\n Default behavior uses the cover image It is possible to override the image used as cover thanks to the actionGetProductPropertiesAfter    3/ Front-office product page\n  For a simple product (no combination), its product page will display all images that were uploaded on the back-office: the cover image as the first image and all other images saved for the product in thumbnails\n  For a product with combinations, different images can be displayed according to the option chosen (detailed in the previous paragraph) :\n  If no image is selected in the product combination, the behavior will be the same as for simple products: all product images will be displayed, the cover image as the first image and all other images saved for the product in thumbnails\n  If only one photo is chosen for a specific combination, then when going to the combination URL, only this image will be displayed.\n  If several images are chosen for a specific combination, then when going to the combination URL, all selected images will be displayed, the 1st image in the list as the main image and all other images in thumbnails.\n    For the canonical URL of a product with combinations, the same images are displayed as the default product combination\n  "

	"content": "SPECS PRODUCT PAGE As a merchant I need to be able to correctly create, edit and delete my products.\nWHY The add / edit product page (Catalog \u0026gt; Products) has already been migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.0 version, but many behaviours are not specified which have introduced regressions and bugs. We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test and avoid any new bugs.\nFurthermore, we have identified different issues related to this page that we should fix during the re-migration : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891\nWHAT Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with when creating / editing a product for his/her customers.\nSPECIFICATIONS The first step is to detail the behavior of each field per tab when creating / editing a product.\nThe second step of this document is to detail the type of each fields and error messages per tab.\nThe third step is to detail the multistore behavior.\n1. Product creation / edition on Back office  If I filled something in a tab and I try to click on another tab, a silent autosave is done: When we detect a click on another tab, we trigger the save. If it works, we open the new tab and display a success message \u0026ldquo;Settings successfully saved\u0026rdquo;. If it fails, we display a warning message to user: \u0026ldquo;Settings cannot be saved\u0026rdquo; (issue 18461)\nIf I filled something in a tab and I change the product type (from example from virtual to standard), then what I had filled in the tab (example virtual product tab) is kept for the fields which are displayed again in the equivalent tab (for example quantity for a standard product)\nElements in all tabs [EPIC] As a merchant I want to always see some elements when I create or edit a product.\nSome elements are displayed in all tabs. Here is the list of those elements\n Product name: When you create a new product, this field is empty and there is a placeholder: “Enter your product name”. Only the name in the employee language must be filled. If the name of the product is not indicated for the other languages, after saving the name of the product in the employee\u0026rsquo;s language is retrieved and displayed for all the other languages.  A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic. Product type: Drop-down with 3 : Standard product, Pack of products, Virtual product. Please note, when editing a standard product with combinations, you can’t change the type, the drop-down is disabled. Sales: This link redirect to Stats \u0026gt; product detail and is open in a new browser tab Product list: Link that displays the list of all products filtered as in the catalog, with their id, name, price, quantity. If you click on the id or the name, you arrive on the product page in basic settings tab. If you click on the price, you arrive on the product page in pricing tab. If you click on the quantity, you arrive on the product page in the second tab which is: Quantities for a standard product without combinations or a pack, Combinations for a standard product with combination, Virtual product for a virtual product. Help: Link to display the help in the right menu. Delete: Button to delete the product. When you click on it, you have a modal to cancel or confirm the action. Preview: When you click on this button, it saves and open a new browser tab with the product displayed in front-office. If the product is disabled (offline), you have on the product page in front-office a message displayed: “This product is not visible to your customers.” Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + V Online: When you click on this button, it saves and makes the product visible in front-office. Offline: When you click on this button, it saves and makes the product invisible in front-office. Save: Button to save all changes made in all tabs. Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + S. If it’s saved with success, there is a green success message “Settings updated”. Otherwise, there is an error message. Duplicate: When you click on this button, it saves and duplicate the current product (the duplicated product will be offline). The duplicated product must be exactly the same. Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + D Go to catalog: When you click on this button, it saves and redirect to catalog product list. Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + Q Add new product: When you click on this button, it saves and opens a new empty product page. Keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + P  When merchant leaves the product page for a product that have never been saved, a pop up is displayed to confirm the action. If the merchant confirms then the product is deleted otherwise the merchant stay on the product page.\nBasic settings tab [EPIC] As a merchant I want to be able to complete the basic information of my products.\nIt is necessary to save the basic settings tab informations in order to access the combinaition tab. Until saved, other tabs are disabled with a tooltip on hover. Here are the mockup of the disabled tabs behavior: https://invis.io/3RWZILBJWQH#/414747857_Disabled_Tabs___Tooltip\nHere is the list of the elements of basic settings tab:\n  Combinations: If you have selected standard product in the drop-down, you have 2 radios buttons: simple product or product with combinations. If product with combination is selected, under the two radio buttons, there is a “combinations” link. When you click on it, you switch to combinations tab. If product with combinations was selected \u0026amp; combinations were generated, when I change for simple product, a modal is displayed alerting all combinations will be deleted and ask to confirm or cancel the action.\n  Reference: The reference is displayed in the product details part in front-office.\n  Summary: The text can be formatted thanks to the TinyMCE editor (improvement 14985) A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic (improvement 16299)\n  Description: The text can be formatted thanks to the TinyMCE editor (improvement 14985) A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic (improvement 16299)\n  Quantity: This field is not displayed for a product with combinations. This field is not displayed if stock management is disabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Products settings. If simple product is selected, under the quantity field, there is a “quantities” link. When you click on it, you switch to quantities tab (for a standard product) or to virtual product tab (for a virtual product). When you update the field in basic settings tab, the same field in quantities (for a standard product) / virtual product tab is updated. The quantity is displayed in front-office if the option “Display available quantities on the product page” in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings is set to yes. This value is decremented when an order is placed except if the order status is Payement error. This value is incremented when the order status is cancelled, when you make a partial refund and check “Re-stock products” and when you return products and check “Re-stock products”.\n  Price tax excl: When a value is filled, the price tax incl field is calculated automatically according to the tax rule chosen. To separate decimals a dot or a comma can be used, both should work no matter the language. When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.\n  Price tax incl: This field shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be displayed if taxes are disabled in International \u0026gt; Taxes (issue 15330). When a value is filled, the price tax excl field is calculated automatically according to the tax rule chosen. To separate decimals a dot or a comma can be used, both should work no matter the language. When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated.\n  Tax rule: This field shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be displayed if taxes are disabled in International \u0026gt; Taxes (issue 15330). Drop-down with all tax rules enabled and a “no tax” option. If there are several taxes rules with the same name, then the ID of the tax rule is displayed before its name. When you change it, the price tax incl is updated. And the “tax rule” field in Pricing tab is also changed. If you select an United States tax rule, price tax incl = price tax excl because it is a tax per state and we can not say in which state is the shop. When you change it, the same field in pricing tab is also updated. Under the tax rule drop down, there is a “pricing” link. When you click on it, you switch to pricing tab.\n  Search category: Search field to search a category. You can search by category name. When you start typing, if there are results, they are displayed and highlighted ( issue 14052) under and you can click on it.\n  Select category: Allows to associate categories to the product. A category is necessarily selected, it is impossible not to have one. When you create a new product, “Home” is selected. When you search a category elements are highlighted in dropdown when using keyboard and hover with mouse (issue 14052). When you click on the result, the category appears in “associated category” and is checked in the list. You can also select a category in the tree by clicking in the checkbox, then the category appears in “associated category”.\n  Unselect category: You can unselect a category by unchecking the checkbox in the tree. Then, the category is removed in “associated category”. You can also click on the cross in “associated category”. Then, the checkbox for the corresponding category is unchecked. If you try to unselect all categories, you can’t do it for the last one.\n  Category tree: When you create a new product, the tree is open for the first 2 levels of categories (issue 14955). When I click on \u0026ldquo;collapse\u0026rdquo; it folds the whole tree. I can also click on each parent to folds / unfolds its subcategories. When I click on \u0026ldquo;expend\u0026rdquo; the whole tree is opened. Categories are sorted by level AND position: Categ 1 level 1 position 1 Categ 3 level 1 position 2 Categ 2 level 1 position 3 Categ 2-2 level 2 position 1 Categ 2-1 level 2 position 2\n  Main category: Radio button to select the main category of the product. There can only be one. The main category is the one that will be in the product URL, before the product name and in the breadcrumb in front-office you have all parent categories up to the main one.\n  Create a new category: When you click on the button “Create a category”, this button disappears, a field “New category name” and a drop-down “parent of the category” are displayed with 2 buttons Cancel and Create.\n  New category name: Allows to create quickly a new category. The name will be the same in all languages. Alphanumeric field. Maximum 128 characters. Invalid characters are: \u0026lt;\u0026gt;;=#{} When you save, if your category name contains an invalid character, an error message under the field should be displayed “This value is not valid.”\n  Parent of the category: Drop-down with all categories enabled, sorted by level and position: Categ 1 level 1 position 1 Categ 3 level 1 position 2 Categ 2 level 1 position 3 Categ 2-2 level 2 position 1 Categ 2-1 level 2 position 2\n  Image upload: Upload zone. When there is no image, you have the following message displayed “Drop images her or select files. Recommended size 800 x 800px for default theme. JPG, GIF or PNG format.” You can click in the entire zone to open the selector or you can drop one or many images in the entire zone. When there is already an image, you can click only on the frame with the “+” to open the selector.\n  Image order: You can move the images in the product sheet, the order is well changed in front-office. The drag icon isn\u0026rsquo;t displayed when many images are selected and you can\u0026rsquo;t move many images\n  Image caption: You can click on an uploaded image and add a caption. You can put a caption by language. The caption is displayed in front-office when you hover the thumbnail image according to the selected language.\n  Cover image: You can click on an uploaded image to assign it as cover image. There is necessarily a cover image. There can be only one cover image. If you upload many images, the first image selected is the cover image. The cover image is displayed in product list in front-office. You can change the cover image by clicking on an image, check the checkbox “cover image” and click on Save. If it was checked for another image, then it’s unchecked.\n  Zoom: You can zoom on an uploaded image by clicking on it and click on “Zoom”. The image is open in its default size. You can close it by clicking on the cross, outside the image or pressing ESC key. Merchants should be able to navigate between several images in zoom view to have an easy last check before saving the page.\n  Delete: You can click on an uploaded image to delete it. When you click on “delete”, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action.\n  Bulk actions: (issue #12773) You can select many images with the checkboxes. After selecting more than one image, the frame on the right is opened with:\n  The number of images selected\n  An \u0026ldquo;Unselect all\u0026rdquo; link to unselect images and close the frame\n  The \u0026ldquo;zoom\u0026rdquo; button to open the first image of the list zoomed\n  A “delete all” button to delete all the product images. When you click on “delete all”, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action.\n  The cross to close the frame and unselect images\n  Caption field: You can enter a caption which will be applied to all images. If some selected images already had captions, they are replaced when clicking on Save.\nIf more than one image is selected the checkbox \u0026ldquo;cover\u0026rdquo; disappears\n    Add a feature: By default the selected option is \u0026ldquo;Choose a feature\u0026rdquo;. All the features are displayed in the drop-down and are sorted by position ASC. If there are several features with the same name, then the ID of the feature is displayed before its name If you have not yet selected a feature, the “pre-defined value” drop-down is disabled and the “customized value” fields should be also disabled (issue 16306) When you select a feature, both fields (pre-defined \u0026amp; customized value) are enabled. The features and the associated values are displayed in product details tab of the front-office.\n  Feature pre-defined value: All the values of the selected feature are displayed in the drop-down and are sorted by name ASC. If there are several features' values with the same name, then the ID of the feature\u0026rsquo;s value is displayed before its name If you select a pre-defined value, the customized value should be disabled because a feature can’t have both (issue 16306) When you add a feature with a pre-defined value, it’s added in all languages enabled.\n  Feature customized value: If you start enter a customized value, the pre-defined value drop-down should be disabled because a feature can’t have both (issue 16306) When you add a feature with a customized value, the feature is added in all languages enabled but the customized value field stays empty in the other languages than the selected one. A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic (improvement 16299)\n  Delete feature: Button to delete the feature. When you click on it, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action. When you delete a feature, it’s deleted in all languages.\n  Add a brand: By default the selected option is \u0026ldquo;Choose a brand\u0026rdquo;. (issue 9678) All the brands enabled are displayed in the drop-down. If there are several brands with the same name, then the ID of the brand is displayed before its name. The brand is displayed in the product page in front-office in product details tab. The logo of the brand is displayed if the brand has a logo, otherwise the name of the brand is displayed. When you add a brand, it’s added in all languages enabled.\n  Delete a brand: Button to delete the brand. When you click on it, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action. When you delete a brand, it’s deleted in all languages.\n  Add a related product: Search field to search a product. You can search by product name or product reference. When you start typing, if there are results, they are displayed and highlighted in dropdown when using keyboard and hover with mouse (issue 14052). You can click on it to select it. It should not be possible to associate the same product with itself or to associate the same product several times (issue 9960) You can have many associated products.\n  Delete a related product: The trash button is to delete all related products. When you click on it, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action. If you want to delete only one associated product, you can click on the cross. When you click on it, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action.\n  Pack search for a product: Select Pack of products as product type in the drop-down. A search field to search a product is displayed. You can search by product name or product reference. When you start typing, if there are results, they are displayed and highlighted in dropdown when using keyboard and hover with mouse (issue 14052) If you try to search another product that is alreay a pack, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be displayed in the dropdown because you can\u0026rsquo;t add a pack in a pack. When you select a result, then the product name is inserted in the search bar. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to add the same product several times to the pack. If the product is already in the pack, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t see it in the results (issue 9617)\n  Pack quantity\n Pack add a product: Button to add the product in the quantity specified to the pack. Pack delete a product: When you hover one of the pack products, a trash appears to remove the product from the pack. When you click on it, you have a modal for cancel or confirm the action.  Second tab  The second tab name changes depending on the type of product selected :\n Quantities for a standard product without combinations or a pack Virtual product for a virtual product. Combinations for a standard product with combination  Quantities tab [EPIC] As a merchant I want to be able to manage my products quantities.\nHere is the list of the elements of quantities tab:\n Quantity: This field is not displayed if stock management is disabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Products settings. When you update the field in quantities tab, the same field in basic settings tab is updated. The quantity is displayed in front-office if the option “Display available quantities on the product page” in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings is set to yes. This value is decremented when an order is placed except if the order status is Payement error. This value is incremented when the order status is cancelled, when you make a partial refund and check “Re-stock products” and when you return products and check “Re-stock products”. Minimum quantity for sale: In front-office (product page \u0026amp; quick-view), this value is indicated in the quantity field. When this value is \u0026gt; 1, a message is displayed under the quantity field in front-office “The minimum purchase order quantity for the product is X.” Stock location: This field should not be displayed for a virtual product (issue 9623) Low stock level: You can define a value and choose or not to receive an email when the product quantity is \u0026lt;= to this value. Send me an email when the quantity is below or equals this level: Checkbox, when it’s checked an email is sent to all the employees who have at least the “view” right on the stock page when the quantity is below or equal to this value. Pack quantities: Dropdown with 4 options, displayed only when the product type is pack: 1) Decrement pack only: Only the pack quantity is decremented when you order it. 2) Decrement products in pack only: Only the products contained in the pack are decremented, the pack isn’t. 3) Decrement both: The pack and the products contained in the pack are decremented. 4) Default: Can be one of the 3 values above, it depends on what is selected in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Products \u0026gt; Default pack stock management. Availability preferences, behavior when out of stock:  This field is not displayed if stock management is disabled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Products settings.\n3 radios buttons: 1) Deny orders: when it’s checked and product quantity is \u0026lt;= 0, in front-office product page and quick view, the message filled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings \u0026gt; Label of out-of-stock products with denied backorders is displayed under the add to cart button, which is disabled. 2) Allow orders: when it’s checked and product quantity is \u0026lt;= 0, in front-office product page and quick view, the message filled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings \u0026gt; Label of out-of-stock products with allowed backorders is displayed under the add to cart button, which is enabled. 3) Use default behavior (Deny orders or Allow orders): the default behavior is set in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings \u0026gt; Allow ordering of out-of-stock products: Yes or No. This value is checked when you create a new product.\n Label when in stock: If completed and product quantity is \u0026gt; 0, it is displayed in front-office product page and quick view, instead of the message filled in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Product settings \u0026gt; Label of in-stock products.

	"content": "Specifications related to SEO in PrestaShop Introduction SEO is key when choosing an ecommerce solution. A CMS which is SEO optimized is a strategic added value for many merchants, and an important selection criterion. It’s also a key factor for brand image and differentiation with our competitors.\nIn the meantime, some technical and functional choices can have a huge impact (positive or negative) on stores’ SEO. It is exactly what happened between 1.6 and 1.7, when it was chosen to change the product URL pattern in 1.7 to avoid a technical issue present in 1.6 (more information below).\nSince the 1.7.4 and especially 1.7.5, we have focused on SEO improvement. A lot of SEO optimizations have been added in the template and in URLs to improve stores’ SEO (see a few examples here) without introducing breaking changes between minor versions. So it’s not possible to modify some “structuring choices” that were introduced in 1.7.\nBelow are listed all specifications of the current way the SEO is working or should be working on PrestaShop, for all different available pages (product, category, cms pages, etc.).\nGENERIC SEO SPECIFICATIONS  PrestaShop URLs and friendly URLs  In Traffic \u0026amp; SEO \u0026gt; SEO \u0026amp; URLs \u0026gt; Set up URLs, the merchant has different options to set up his website’s urls according to his needs.\nOne recommended option is to set to YES the friendly url option.\nBy default, PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s deep URLs (that is, specific pages rather than online the domain name) are uninformative to both customers and search engines: a URL such as http://www.myprestashop.com/product.php?id_product=27 does not help visitors know what product is on that page. Friendly URLs are the way to achieve that and get for instance http://www.myprestashop.com/2-music-players/27-ipod-nano-green. As you can see in the second example above, both categories and products can have a friendly URL: in the example above, id_category=2 becomes 2-music-players, and id_product=27 becomes 27-ipod-nano-green. While the ID number cannot be removed by default, the words can be either generated from the category/product name or written by hand. For products, categories and CMS pages, this is done directly in their own configuration page. For all other pages, friendly urls can be updated in Traffic \u0026amp; SEO \u0026gt; SEO \u0026amp; URLs.\nWhen rewriting the URL after the ID (of the product, the category, or the page), there should be an automatic redirection to the canonical URL. So if a link is :\n entered without www, it should redirect to www IF it is domain shop is correctly defined with www. entered with the wrong link rewrite text, it should redirect to the correct link. Nevertheless, there are some specific behaviours for products (with and without combinations), which are detailed in the paragraph dedicated to products below.  When editing in the back-office the rewriting part of the element (category, cms, product, etc.) and refreshing the page on front-office, there should be an automatic redirection to the new URL with the new rewriting. For product with combinations, there should be an automatic redirection to the same combination with the new rewriting.\n2 specific cases :\n When changing primary domain name, the friendly urls should be automatically reindexed. The #11375 issue related to this has been fixed in 1.7.5.0. When using multishop, it should correctly redirect to the subdomain.  Schema of PrestaShop URL (displayed only if friendly URLs are enabled)\nBy default, route to pages are the following :\n Route to products : {category:/}{id}{-:id_product_attribute}-{rewrite}{-:ean13}.html Route to category : {id}-{rewrite} Route to supplier : supplier/{id}-{rewrite} Route to brand : brand/{id}-{rewrite} Route to page : content/{id}-{rewrite} Route to page category : content/category/{id}-{rewrite} Route to modules : module/{module}{/:controller}  For supplier and brand pages, this is a change that was introduced in 1.7.5, to avoid having “_” in URLs, which is a bad practice. It used to be looking like : “test.com/IDOFBRAND_BRANDNAME” and has been replaced with “test.com/brand/IDOFBRAND-BRANDNAME” and “test.com/supplier/IDOFSUPPLIER-SUPPLIER”.\nYou can change the way friendly URLs are generated, by changing the route to a resource in your shop. For instance, the default route to display a product\u0026rsquo;s page is {category:/}{id}-{rewrite}{-:ean13}.html, which results in /summer-dresses/7-printed-chiffon-dress.html. You could change that route to {manufacturer:/}{id}-{rewrite:/} to obtain /fashion-manufacturer//7-printed-chiffon-dress/ Eight fields are available by default, and each is accompanied by a list of available keywords. Some keywords are mandatory and are indicated with a \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen changing the route to pages (according to what is possible), there should be an automatic redirection to the new canonical URL, for every type of page or product (with and without combinations). A bug related to this is being fixed for 1.7.6.5.\n Titles and metatitles  Main page configurations (product, category, cms, attribute, brand, supplier, etc.) make it possible to give the page a specific title and metatitle. The merchant can modify them according to his needs. By leaving the metatitle field empty, the title name will be used.\nIn 1.7.5, the metatitle field has been added to cms pages to make it possible to differentiate the title and meta title in a cms page.\n PrestaShop H1\u0026hellip;Hn \u0026amp; Hreflang tags  In PrestaShop, all pages should have only one H1 tag, which is defined in the front-office template. In the classic theme, a fix was brought in 1.7.5 as there were 2 H1 tags in the category pages for the category names\nHreflang rules : To be completed\n PrestaShop microdata  The Google search console should not display any errors related to microdata, as it is key for SEO and Google. Some errors (here and here) were found and fixed in 1.7.7\n PrestaShop breadcrumbs on Front office  On PrestaShop main pages, breadcrumbs are available on top of the page to ease the visitor’s navigation by displaying a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the website\u0026rsquo;s structure. Some pages are missing, below is listed the list of pages with and without breadcrumbs :\n Products : OK Search results : OK Categories : OK CMS pages : OK bestsales : OK newproducts : OK pricesdrop : OK myaccount : OK password : OK My account : OK history: OK (last key was missing, fixed in 1.7.7) identity : OK (last key was missing, fixed in 1.7.7) discount : OK (last key was missing, fixed in 1.7.7) addresses : OK (last key was missing, fixed in 1.7.7) Order slip : OK (last key was missing, fixed in 1.7.7) Login page + registration : NOK stores : NOK sitemap : NOK suppliers : NOK basket : NOK ⇒ the following issue will be adding the missing breadcrumbs : #15440  The current generic rule for front-office breadcrumb is the following :\n All previous elements of the breadcrumb are clickable and allow the visitor to easily go to the home page or the main category page for instance The last element, corresponding to the current page the user is on, is not clickable to avoid a useless redirection to the same page. This is useful for both user experience and SEO. This has no impact on structured data validity. This new behaviour has been introduced in 1.7.7.0 (issues are available here : #13083 and #15378) In the code source, the breadcrumb should only contain one element (the name of the current page). An issue related to this has been fixed in 1.7.7.  SEO FOR PRODUCT PAGES AND PRODUCT LISTINGS  Product page title  Since 1.7.5, it is possible to automatically add attributes to the product page title. This means that the page title can either be “Product name” or \u0026ldquo;Product name Attribute 1 Attribute 2\u0026hellip; Attribute X\u0026rdquo; according to the chosen option.\nThis option can be found in Traffic \u0026amp; SEO \u0026gt; SEO \u0026amp; URLs \u0026gt; SEO options : Display attributes in the product meta title (YES/NO). If setting the option to yes, the attributes must change in the metatitle, According to the combination chosen.\nThis option has been introduced in 1.7.5 with the following issues : #9508 and #11927\n Product canonical urls  There used to be a known issue which was quite critical to merchants and agencies, and was one reason explaining why many users refuse to migrate to the latest PS version.\nExplanation of the issue :\n  URL in 1.6 version : www.monsite.fr/10-leproduit.html#/couleur-jaune What comes after # (anchor) comes with the activation of the faceted search module, it is not part of the URL and is not taken into account by search bots.\n  In 1.7, it has been decided to add an ID in the product URL for the corresponding attribute of the product. URL in 1.7 version : www.monsite.fr/10-16-leproduit.html#/couleur-jaune URL of the default product : www.monsite.fr/10-leproduit.html\n  Before 1.7.6, there was a problematic issue on PS 1.7 with the management of canonical urls (It’s the url that is considered by default by Google and for SEO purposes) of product combinations : PS 1.7 generated a canonical URL to the default product URL (without combination ID) and not the product combination. The canonical URL was never available nor existing when the products had combinations. There was an automatic redirection to the default combination url.\nWith the example : the canonical url for this product “www.monsite.fr/10-16-leproduit.html#/couleur-jaune” was www.monsite.fr/10-leproduit.html instead of www.monsite.fr/10-16-leproduit.html\nIt means that there were several URLs for each “parent reference”. Each url of a combination had a canonical url which redirected to the parent reference url BUT this URL had a 301 redirection to the default combination URL. The parent reference URL was not visible on the website. To fix these issues, an important update has been done on canonical urls for combination products. The current generic rule for canonical url is the following : the parent product URL must stay the default canonical URL (with no combination ID nor anchor) http://wandering-expert.machine-shuffle.prestashop.net/fr/hommes/1-hummingbird-printed-t-shirt.html There is NO automatic redirection to the default combination, the URL remains available and displays the default combination the combinations urls still work and their canonical url is the parent url. When changing the combination on the product page, the combination url is used : http://wandering-expert.machine-shuffle.prestashop.net/fr/hommes/1-1-hummingbird-printed-t-shirt.html#/1-taille-s/8-couleur-blanc\nThis change should NOT have any impact on the URL rewrite. As explained above, even when entering the wrong link rewrite text, it should redirect to the correct URL.\nFor a simple product without combinations, it’s the same behaviour as explained before : if the url rewrite is different from the canonical url, then there should be an automatic redirection to the canonical url. Ex : https://myshop.com/en/art/12-mountain-fooooooox-vector-graphics.html → automatic redirection to https://myshop.com/en/art/12-mountain-fox-vector-graphics.html\nFor a product with combinations, the behaviour is slightly different :\n If the attribute ID is invalid, then there is an automatic redirection to the canonical url. Ex : https://myshop.com/en/women/2-152-brown-bear-printed-sweater.html (the ID 152 does not exist) → automatic redirection to https://myshop.com/en/women/2-brown-bear-printed-sweater.html If the attribute ID is correct but the product rewrite is not, then there should be an automatic redirection to the correct combination url. Ex : https://myshop.com/en/women/2-9-brown-beaaaaaaaar-printed-sweater.html → automatic redirection to https://myshop.com/en/women/2-9-brown-bear-printed-sweater.html   Disabling products  When disabling a product, by default its url redirects (301 redirection) to the main category it belongs to. This can be changed and configured in the SEO tab of the product page. The merchant can either choose :\n 301 redirect to the category of his choice 301 redirect to the category of his choice 302 redirect to the category of his choice 302 redirect to the category of his choice No redirect (404)  SEO FOR CATEGORY PAGES AND PAGINATION Many categories or product listings can present several pages on front office if the number of products available exceeds the “products per page” number defined in Shop Parameters \u0026gt; Product Settings \u0026gt; Pagination.\nIn this situation, when going to page X (after page 1), the category title block is removed. This change has been introduced in 1.7.5 to prevent duplicated content.\n"

This is why no design has been specified for CRUD (with create - read - update - delete actions) pages.\nPlease note that many pages in the BO have very specific behaviour and need their own redesign. This is why it is crucial to follow the roadmap which have been defined, in order to anticipate sketch needs.\n1) Tables\nIn tables and listings, some improvements and changes in behaviour have been decided :\n Search : when searching for an ID \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo;, only the element with this exact ID should be displayed. Previously, all elements including this ID were being shown. Filter :  2) Tables with drag \u0026amp; drop\n3) Add new / other actions\n4) Configuration blocks\n"

We need to specify the whole behaviour of this page to make it easier to test and avoid any new bugs.\nFurthermore, we have identified different issues related to this page that we should fix during the re-migration : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/13891\nWHAT Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with when creating / editing a product for his/her customers.\nSPECIFICATIONS The first step is to detail the behavior of each field per tab when creating / editing a product.\nThe second step of this document is to detail the type of each fields and error messages per tab.\nThe third step is to detail the multistore behavior.\n1. Product creation / edition on Back office  Elements in all tabs [EPIC] As a merchant I want to always see some elements when I create or edit a product.\nSome elements are displayed in all tabs. Here is the list of those elements :\n Product name: When you create a new product, this field is empty and there is a placeholder: “Enter your product name”. Only the name in the default language must be filled, if the product name is not filled for all languages, then it must retrieve the product name in the default language. A drop-down next to the field is displayed when there are several languages installed (disabled languages are diplayed in the drop-down). It allows to choose in which language the field is displayed. If the content does not exist in a language, it must retrieve the content of the default language. Also, in the case of multilanguage, if an error occurs, then I must be warned in the message which language is problematic. Product type: Drop-down with 3 : Standard product, Pack of products, Virtual product. Please note, when editing a standard product with combinations, you can’t change the type, the drop-down is disabled.

	"content": "Translations Conceptual vocabulary  Wordings: original texts found throughout the software. Although these messages are written in English, they are actually only tokens to be translated into any language, including English variations (eg. British, American). Translations: wordings translated to a given language. Translation domain: named logic group of wordings. Any given wording is attached to one and only one translation domain. Two identical wordings attached to two different translation domains are considered as two different wordings. Translation catalogue: A collection of translation domains containing translations for a given language, stored physically in a support like files or on a database. Default catalogue: The master translation catalogue that contains the wordings but not its translations. It\u0026rsquo;s included in the GitHub project.  Modify translations section This section allows the user to modify all translations used in PrestaShop.\nIn order to modify translations, the user must first choose which translation type they want to edit, then the language they want to edit it for (eg. French).\nThe translation types are as follows:\n Back office translations Front office translations Installed modules translations Email translations Other translations  Once you click on the \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo; button, you go to the translation interface.\nParticular cases  When the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Front office translations\u0026rdquo;, a list of all the installed themes except \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; + a special item called \u0026ldquo;Core translations\u0026rdquo; is displayed as well. When the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, a list of all the installed modules is displayed as well. When the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Email translations\u0026rdquo;, a list containing \u0026ldquo;Subject\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Body\u0026rdquo; is displayed as well.  If the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Body\u0026rdquo;, a list of all the installed themes (including classic) + a special item called \u0026ldquo;Core\u0026rdquo; is displayed as well.  This type sends the user to the legacy translation interface, where the user can edit the rendered templates, instead of the one described below. The email translations (body) interface described below is accessible from the Design \u0026gt; Email theme \u0026gt; Translate emails page.      Translation interface This interface displays two columns. In the left, there\u0026rsquo;s a tree of translation domains according to the translation type the user chose before.\nThe tree is composed by separating translation domain parts using dots. Eg:\nAdmin ├── Actions ├── AdvParameters │ ├── Feature │ ├── Help │ └── Notification └── Global The tree above represents the following translation domains:\n Admin.Actions Admin.AdvParameters.Feature Admin.AdvParameters.Help Admin.AdvParameters.Notification Admin.Global  Only the leaves of this tree are clickable. On the right, the list of wordings belonging to the currently selected domain are shown, each followed by a text field containing its translation to the selected language.\nThe user can edit translations by filling out the fields, and save them.\nOn the top of the page, there\u0026rsquo;s a search box. When the user searches for a wording, the list is filtered, meaning that wordings not matching the search expression are no longer shown on the list and domains containing no matching wording are grayed out.\nTranslation sources \u0026amp; storage This section covers where wordings are sourced from and where translations are stored to according to the translation type chosen.\nGeneralities Usually and unless specified otherwise:\n Wordings are sourced from XLF files stored somewhere, one file per translation domain. User-edited translations are stored in the database  Back office translations Wordings are sourced from the Core\u0026rsquo;s default catalogue, which is stored as physical XLF files (one per translation domain) in app/Resources/translations/default. This catalogue is to be filtered by keeping only the translation domains whose name starts with \u0026ldquo;Admin\u0026rdquo;.\nTranslations are retrieved from two sources:\n The core: XLF translation files for the chosen language, stored in app/Resources/translations/{locale_code}, one per domain. The database: if translations were customized previously through this interface.  If the same wording is translated in both core files and database, the database translation is shown.\nFront office translations This translation type has two different subcases:\ni. If the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Core translations\u0026rdquo;.\nThe behavior is exactly like \u0026ldquo;back office translations\u0026rdquo;, only that translation domains are filtered by domains starting with \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo; instead.\nii. If the user chooses a theme.\nIn this case, wordings are sourced by analyzing all the theme\u0026rsquo;s files. Since this process is slow, the result of this analysis is stored as XLF files in local filesystem cache. If the cache is found, then wordings are read from there. The user can refresh this cache by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Find new wordings\u0026rdquo; button at the top of the page.\nTranslations are sourced exactly like if the user had chosen \u0026ldquo;Core translations\u0026rdquo;, then adding the ones from database translations starting with \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo; and where \u0026ldquo;theme\u0026rdquo; is empty, then adding the XLF files within the theme in its translations/{locale_code} directory, one per domain. Each catalog replaces the translations from the previous one. Catalogs must be loaded in this order:\n Core xlf files (translated) Core database translation (no theme) Theme xlf files (translated)  Note: the core catalog must be filtered as to not include translations that are not used by the theme (otherwise you end up with all the Core translations).\nUser-edited translations are stored in database. To avoid collisions, theme translations must be kept associated to the theme they belong. If a theme redefines a Core translation (ie. same domain, same wording), then the redefined translation should only be used when the FO is using that theme (eg. in case of multishop with different themes for each shop, each theme should use the its own translation even if they both use the same given wording/domain pair). Redefined core translations should only be saved if they\u0026rsquo;re different than the ones defined when not in the theme\u0026rsquo;s context.\nInstalled module translations Note: modules have to opt-in for this feature (see documentation).\nWordings are pulled from a sequence of sources:\nFirst, the Core\u0026rsquo;s default catalogue, which is stored as physical XLF files (one per translation domain) in app/Resources/translations/default. This catalogue is to be filtered by keeping only the translation domains whose name starts with \u0026ldquo;Modules.Nameofthemodule\u0026rdquo;.\n Note: this is the case of native modules which have their catalogue integrated in the core\n If no file is found, then wordings are sourced by analyzing all the module\u0026rsquo;s files. Since this process is slow, the result of this analysis is stored as XLF files in local filesystem cache. If the cache is found, then wordings are read from there. The user can refresh this cache by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Find new wordings\u0026rdquo; button at the top of the page.\nTranslations are retrieved from a list of sources:\n The core: XLF translation files for the chosen language, stored in app/Resources/translations/{locale_code}, one per domain. The module: XLF translations files for the chosen language, stored within the module in the translations/{locale_code} directory, one per domain. The module\u0026rsquo;s legacy files: PHP translation files for the chosen language, stored within the module in the translations/ directory, one per language code. The database: if translations were customized previously through this interface.  If the module uses Core translations, they are not shown on this interface.\nIf the same wording is translated in the core, the module files and the database, the database translation is shown.\nEmail translations (subject) The behavior is exactly like \u0026ldquo;back office translations\u0026rdquo;, but using only the domain called \u0026ldquo;Emails.Subject\u0026rdquo;.\nEmail translations (body) The behavior is exactly like \u0026ldquo;back office translations\u0026rdquo;, but using only the domain called \u0026ldquo;Emails.Body\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter saving the translations, the email templates must be regenerated for the translated language.\nOther translations The behavior is exactly like \u0026ldquo;back office translations\u0026rdquo;, but using only the domain called \u0026ldquo;messages\u0026rdquo;.\nWorkflow Each source mentioned in the previous parts represents a level in the translation workflow:\n the default catalog is the translation basis; it is overwritten by the translation files when downloaded through a localization pack or this interface (\u0026lsquo;Add / Update a language\u0026rsquo; section); it is overwritten by the database if the translation has been customized, still through this interface (\u0026lsquo;Modify translations\u0026rsquo; section).  It works the same for the modules that have their own translation files:\n the default catalog is the translation basis; it is overwritten by the translation files when downloaded through a localization pack or this interface (\u0026lsquo;Add / Update a language\u0026rsquo; section); it is overwritten by the module\u0026rsquo;s translation files, cf 1.7.8 issue #14968. it is overwritten by the database if the translation has been customized, still through this interface (\u0026lsquo;Modify translations\u0026rsquo; section).  Export translations section This feature allows the user to export translations in a given language. The user is given a list of options to choose what kind of translations they want to export:\n PrestaShop translations When chosen, the following checkboxes appear below this option:  Back Office Front Office Email Other   Theme translations When chosen, a select box containing the installed themes (except classic theme) appears below. Installed modules translations When chosen, a select box containing the installed modules appears below.  When the user clicks on \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;, a zip file is generated and downloaded.\nThe exported package The generated zip filename pattern will be translations_export_{locale_code}.zip\nThe generated zip contains exported translation domains, stored as XLF files (one per domain), each one containing of all the domain\u0026rsquo;s wordings and their translation to the target language.\nNote: If a given wording is not translated, then the original wording should be used as translation in the exported file.\nThe domains that are included in the export package depend on the combination of options chosen in the form, as described below.\nExport PrestaShop translations Each translation type roughly matches the translation sources described in the \u0026ldquo;Translation sources \u0026amp; storage\u0026rdquo; section above:\n Back office: Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Back office translations\u0026rdquo;. Front office: Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Front office - Core translations\u0026rdquo;. Email: Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Email translations\u0026rdquo; (subject \u0026amp; body) Other: Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Other translations\u0026rdquo;.  The exported package should include all XLF files stored under a language directory, like so:\nfr-FR ├── AdminActions.fr-FR.xlf ├── AdminAdvparametersFeature.fr-FR.xlf ├── AdminAdvparametersHelp.fr-FR.xlf └── ... Export Theme translations Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Front office - theme\u0026rdquo;:\nThe catalogs are loaded and overridden in this order (the last one being the one that \u0026ldquo;wins\u0026rdquo; if it exists):\n default catalogue (untranslated) core xlf (translated) database translation (no theme) theme xlf (translated) database translation (theme)  Note: this export may include core translation domains if they are used by the theme\u0026rsquo;s files. However, only the wordings used by the theme are to be included in the exported file.\nThe exported package should include all XLF files stored under a language directory, like so:\nfr-FR ├── ShopMytheme.fr-FR.xlf ├── ShopNavigation.fr-FR.xlf ├── ShopNotificationsError.fr-FR.xlf └── ... Export Installed module translations Translations are sourced in the same way as specified in \u0026ldquo;Installed module translations\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: this export may include core translation domains if they are used by the module\u0026rsquo;s files.

	"content": "Specifications for the order view page for 1.7.7 - 2019 As a merchant, I need to be able to manage all my orders processed on my website.\nAs a merchant, managing my orders is essential for my e-commerce, so I need to be able to:\n Check the order’s products to prepare it Manage the order’s progress, Edit the customer information or send him messages, Print his invoice, Handle payment methods, Follow my shipping through activities, Manage returns and refunds  WHY\nThe order view page (Orders \u0026gt; Orders \u0026gt; View button) is expected to be migrated to Symfony for the 1.7.7 version and will be reworked for improved merchant productivity and user experience.\nSome new specifications for the new design are in progress but to avoid any feature regressions in the future, we need to specify the whole behavior of this page to make it easier to compare the new scenarios and avoid any new bugs and regressions.\nWHAT\nThus, this project aims at specifying the new behaviors for every scenario a merchant could be dealing with in the order management. This specification should specifically define :\nI.

All date and time formats are defined according to CLDR and the display language.\nOrder documents like invoices and delivery slips are, by default, in the customer language. An option allows merchants to turn it into the logistician language in the Shop Parameters \u0026gt; Order Settings page, cf. issue #10258.\nI.

Update the order status The current status is displayed by default on the droplist.

View delivery slip If the current or new order status has the generation of the delivery slip then the button to download the delivery slip is shown.\n5. Summary of the standard refund, partial refund and return product feature Merchandise return has to be enabled if the merchant wants to use the standard refund, partial refund and return product feature    Button Why What is does When is it displayed When is it hidden Option Summarise Behaviours     Cancel products To Cancel a wrong order It deletes the products (or reduce the quantity). It also changes the order status to Canceled when all the products are canceled. At the creation of an order and merchandise return is enabled When the order is considered as paid  Select the products to cancel then their quantity. Press on the cancel products to confirm.   Standard refund To refund products, before it is sent to the customer (the products are still in the stock) Refund by voucher or by credit slip of the total amount of products When the order is considered as paid or at least one payment is linked to the order and Merchandise return is enabled When the order is considered as shipped - Generate a credit slip- Generate voucher- Repay shipping costs (option appears if you select to generate a voucher or a credit slip) Select the products to refund and their quantity.

Then select the refund option. Press on refund products to confirm.    If this order has been partially paid by voucher. The merchant can refund either by selecting the total amount of the selected products or this total minus the amount of the vouchers.\nBefore 1.7.7, it used to have an input to select the specific amount for the voucher. The objective of the field was to customize the voucher value but it was only displayed when a voucher was applied to the order. So to customize a voucher on return product or standard refund, the order has to have a voucher applied in the order. To harmonize the behaviors, we put the specific custom edition into the partial refund button and set the return product button with straightforward options. The merchant can customize the voucher on the partial refund feature.\n6. Partial refund button If the current or new order status of the order is considered as paid then the button is shown. After clicking on the button, then the product table will take the full width of the page. The user can edit the refund amount by product and also the shipping cost. He must select the quantity of the product concerned for the refund and then enter a selected refund amount per product line. The maximum refundable amount is written below all the amount input in tax included.\nBy default, the entered quantity has 0 pre-filled. To release a partial refund, the user must have selected a minimum quantity of 1. The maximum refund is determined by the product totals. The limitation of the refund does not take into account the amount paid whether it is partially or paid by the customer.\nBefore validating a partial refund, the user can choose to re-stock or generate a voucher by checking the checkboxes.\nPartial Refund screen\nAfter the validation of a partial refund, a new column is added with the quantity previously selected and the amount entered.\nWhen the status \u0026ldquo;Refunded\u0026rdquo; is applied to the order, the refund amount is deducted from the total spent by the customer since registration and the number of valid orders placed decreases by 1.\n7. Cancel products button The cancel button is only displayed by default on the creation of an order. The button is hidden when the order is considered as paid\nWhen pressing the button, the product list takes the full with of the page and the column cancel is added. On the column cancel, a checkbox and quantity input is displayed. Checking the checkbox will prefill the quantity input with the quantity of the product ordered. The quantity input can still be editable.\nPressing the button cancel will reduce the quantity of the products selected if there are still some left otherwise it deletes the product from the list.\nTo cancel products at least one of the products must be selected.\nWhen all the products are canceled, the status automatically changes for \u0026ldquo;Canceled\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen the status \u0026ldquo;Canceled\u0026rdquo; is applied to the order, the quantity of products in the order is returned to stock.\n8. Standard products button Standard refund is only displayed when the merchandise returns are activated and the order is considered as paid and is hidden when the order is considered as shipped.\nWhen the user presses the button a column \u0026ldquo;Refund\u0026rdquo; is added with a checkbox and the input quantity.\nA quantity of greater than 0 must be selected to refund a product.\nBefore refunding the products, the user can choose to generate a credit slip and/or voucher.

Next/Previous button ![arrows next/prev](INSERT IMG)\nPressing the left arrow opens the next older order. Pressing the right arrow opens the next recent order. If the first order (the oldest one) is opened, the left arrow is disabled. If the last order (the newest one) is opened, the right arrow is disabled.\nII.

The feature is still available on the customer page. The order is not the place to handle customer management. It was removed to not encourage the merchant to transform Guest to a Customer account by letting a button on the order page.\n3. Shipping and Invoice address Each address has a button to update or change it. The button opens a list to select to edit or update it.

It sends the message by email and adds the message on the front-office on the message section of the order historic page and an email as presented on the screenshots below.\nThe maximum of character in the text input is 1200 char.

Products panel 1. The Product list Below the actions button and on the right of the customer panel, the product panel displays the order’s products into the table list showing:\n the product’s image, product name (with its name, combination name, and reference), stock location, if one of the products has one base price with tax included, quantity, available quantity, total with tax included, and 2 action buttons : edit and delete.

The column is only displayed at the corresponding pagination. If only a product on page 2 of the list has a stock location then the stock location column appears on page 2 and hidden in the other pages.\nPagination design\nThe quantity is colored in a dark grey background if there are at least 2 quantities.\nPossible actions:\nIn an existing order (until it gets the order status “Processing in progress”), it is possible to perform actions on the order’s products and discounts. Merchants can :\n add new products to the order remove products from the order modify elements of existing products add new cart rules to the order  Below the totals, a warning message is displayed to warn the user that for this customer group, prices are displayed as HT or for this customer group, prices are displayed as TTC depending on the customer group setting and also that returns are disabled. when the merchandise return is disabled on the merchandise returns page.\n2. Add new products When clicking on Add a product, it adds a row on the table list with a search bar on the product name column. The merchant can search for any available product. If the desired product has combinations, a drop list appears below the search bar. After selecting the product, the user can edit if needed :\n the base price tax excluded or tax included. When modifying one field, it automatically modifies the second field according to the product tax. the quantity: The quantity input is an input type number that decreases the stock left when the user increases the quantity. If the quantity selected is higher than the stock, the available quantity label becomes red. The product is added in the product table and to the order after pressing on the add button: if the quantity is greater than 0; if the quantity is less than or equal to the quantity available. Otherwise, a warning error is shown (except if the stock parameter allows selling without stocks (in Product quantities tab). In this situation, the merchant can add as many product items as he wants).  When a product is successfully added to the order, a notification of success is displayed: \u0026ldquo;The item was successfully added.\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Notifications.Success. Then the product list is reloaded behind the loading spinner to check if any new products could be added through automatics carts rules. The user is redirected to the first page of the product list.\nWhen I add a product already present in the order from the back office, the addition is blocked by displaying the following error message (EM): \u0026ldquo;This product is already in your order, please edit the quantity instead.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen I have a multi invoice and I add the product to an invoice that already contains the product, the addition is blocked by displaying the following error message \u0026ldquo;This product is already in invoice #number, please edit the quantity instead.\u0026rdquo; localized in Admin.Notifications.Error\n Add a product with a specific price based on the quantity  ORSP1: When a user adds a product with a specific price based on the quantity on the order page of BO, the specific price is applied only if the base price is not edited on the form and the product\u0026rsquo;s quantity is superior or equal to the specific price\u0026rsquo;s quantity.\nWhen a user edits a product with a specific price based on the quantity on the order page of BO, the product price is not updated even if the specific price rule matches the product quantity.\n_Adding a product\u0026rsquo;s combination\nIf the \u0026ldquo;Quantity discounts based on\u0026rdquo; option is set to \u0026ldquo;Products\u0026rdquo;, the specific price rule is only applied if there are no other combinations from the same product in the order and the product\u0026rsquo;s quantity and ORSP1.\nAdding a product already present in the order to a new invoice\nIf a product already exists in the order is added into a new invoice, the specific price on the quantity is not applied.\nA gifted product is not included in the quantity rules of a specific price.\n **Add a product already present in the order  When the merchant wants to add more quantities of the same product, he has to edit the product quantity to add some items.\n Product minimum quantity  The minimum quantity of a product is determined by all the products of the order regardless of whether the products are separated between invoices. It allows a merchant to add a product on another invoice because the minimum quantity is respected in the order. Editing the quantity of the product to a quantity less than the minimum quantity required is authorized, the responsibility belongs to the merchant.\nFor example, when I add a product A with a minimum quantity, if the quantity of the new product A and the current quantity is equal to or greater than the product is added. Otherwise, an error is launched: \u0026ldquo;Error! Minimum quantity of X must be added\u0026rdquo;, X quantity missing to be equal to the required minimum quantity.\nA product allowed to be ordered out of stock can be added to an order without complying with the minimum quantity rule.\n Product associated to cart rule  When I add a product associated with a discount to an order, the discount is also added.\n  In the case of a discount on the total of the order, if I add a second time this product, the discount should not be added and avoid the accumulation of discount.\n  In the case of reduction to a specific product of a fixed amount, the discount is applied only once despite the number of quantities of the same product in the cart and the total per user strictly greater than 1.\n  If the discount is updated the order remains the same.\n Cart rule behaviors  Specific scenario: Adding a product recalculates all discounts and the total price. So if the merchant has a discount linked to a specific product for example at 40%. Then he changes the discount to 50% discount. Finally, he adds a new product, the discount will update and a 50% discount will be applied to the order.\nSpecific scenarios: A product added in an order with a discount attached to it is added in the order as well.\nIn the case of a discount to a specific product by percentage, the discount applies to the total amount of the product taking into account the quantity, i.e. the discount = quantity of the product * %. But only applies once in the basket even if the merchant can still use the discount on other carts (total user for each user \u0026gt; 0).\n Multi invoices behaviors  When I add a product when an invoice is already generated, the merchant can choose to:\n Offer free shipping for this product or apply the shipping cost Associate the product to an existing or new invoice  When the order has several invoices, it is possible to add an already existing product to the order if they are related to a different invoice. There is only one possible price per product even if they are from different invoices. Therefore, if a product is added with a different price in another invoice, the price will be updated on the first invoice. To avoid confusion, a pop-up window will be displayed before the addition to confirm that the action may have an impact on the other order.\n3. Remove products from the order Deleting one or several products is very easy: a remove icon is available to remove one or several quantities of a paid product.\nWhen a product is removed from the order, a notification is displayed: \u0026ldquo;The item was successfully removed.\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Notifications.Error. Then the product list is refreshed behind the loading spinner to check if any gift product has to be removed as well. The user is redirected to the page where the user was when the product has been removed. If the removed product was on the last page, the user is redirected to the second-last page.\nCurrent bug: if I delete the paid product, it will also delete the gifted product (the voucher is still displayed).

All products can be added as favorites:\n Products in and out of stock Standard products Products with combinations Product packs Virtual products Customizable products (text or file)  What product information do I need to retrieve for favorites? All product information:\n Price excl. VAT or incl. VAT + special offers, Photos, Quantity (selected by the customer), Combinations, Customization (if the product can be customized).  Product information (stocks, prices, etc.) is variable and must be updated each time the Favorites page is loaded.\nRules for quantities when adding to favorites:\n If the user chooses a quantity \u0026gt; 1, the product added in favorites has the same quantity as the one on the product sheet. By default, the product is added to the favorites singly. If the product can only be purchased with a minimum of X units, then the product is added to the favorites with its minimum quantity. If the product is out of stock (stock = 0 ou stock \u0026lt; 0) with denying order option: it is saved in favorites with 1 product quantity but the product block is disabled and the visitor cannot add the product to the cart.  Products with combinations:\n When a user adds a product from a listing page (where he/she cannot select any combination), the product added to the wishlist is the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; product combination. That is, the product is added with its default combination and quantity. If the user selects a combination from the product page, then this combination is added and not the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; product combination.  Customizable products:\n Whether the user has filled his customization or not, when he adds a customizable product to his favorites, it is saved without the customization. If the product requires customization, then the user will not be able to add this product to cart without going back to the product page (see US Add to cart) \u0026gt; he will have to click on the CTA \u0026lsquo;Customize in order\u0026rsquo; to be redirected to the product page, fill in the customization, and add it to cart.  Since the customization is not registered in the wishlist, it will not be possible to add the same product twice but with different customizations. The product only appears once in the wishlist.\nLogged-in users:\nFor a logged-in user, clicking on the heart icon displays an in-page pop-up that offers the option to add this product to:\n the default favorites list, a previously created list (if the user does not have created lists previously, the default list is displayed - see below \u0026gt; the pop-up has a min. size),   a new list that can be created by clicking \u0026lsquo;Create New wishlist\u0026rsquo;.   The user can only select one list, so the product can be added to only one list.\nWhat happens in each case?\n When no list has already been created: the logged-in user can add the item(s) to the default favorites list or create a new list. When at least one list has been created: the logged-in user can add the item(s) to the default favorites list, one of the existing lists, or create a new list. When more than X lists have been created: the logged-in user can scroll down to see all the lists created.  Users can create as many lists as they want.\nThe heart icon turns full once the product added to a favorites list.\nHeart icon for combinations: in the listing pages, the heart will not be full if the default combination is not selected.\nIf the user clicks on the full heart again, the product is removed from the wishlist. And if the product is deleted by the seller meanwhile, it should no longer appear in the user\u0026rsquo;s favorites lists.\nNon-logged-in users: For a non-logged-in user: clicking on the heart icon displays an in-page pop-up that informs he/she must log in to proceed.\nWhen clicking on \u0026ldquo;Sign in\u0026rdquo;, the user is redirected to the login page. Once the connection is made, the user is redirected to his/her product or listing page.\nSpecial login features:\n add a go-back setting to the URL so that, once the user is logged in, he/she can be redirected to the page he/she was on (any page) the user is then asked to select the favorites list in which he/she wants to save the product  US 2: View my favorite products As a logged-in user, I can view and sort my favorite products Functional rules:\nWhat type of users can add products to their favorites? Logged-in users only.\nFor non-logged-in users:\nAs a non-logged-in user, I cannot access my favorite products.\nFor logged-in users:\nAs a logged-in user, I can access my favorite products by:\n  Going to my account\n  Clicking on \u0026ldquo;Wishlists\u0026rdquo;   I arrive on the page with all my favorites lists (default one + created lists)   Selecting one of these lists brings me to a new page that lists my previously added favorite products\n  I can know how many favorites a list contains: the number is indicated in brackets next to the list name.\nThis means that it accounts for all the idproduct allocated For example, if there are 3 combinations of the same product it counts as 3 products. In the case of a product pack, this counts as 1 pack and not the number of products in the pack\n  I can view the products and I can sort them as follows:\n Last added (default sorting) Price highest to lowest Price lowest to highest  In all three cases, keep the discount price in mind\nPlease note that if a product is deleted or deactivated from the catalog, the product automatically disappears from the list.\nFor each product, you have to go back to the information listed in US n°1. As a logged-in user, I can see how many unique favorite products are in a list.\nWhat type of users can add products to their favorites? Only logged-in users, since the Favorites list is displayed in My Account.\nUS 3: Edit and/or delete a favorite product As a logged-in user, I can edit and/or delete a favorite product Different cases:\n Products in stock Products out of stock From the product sheet From a favorites list  Functional rules: I can modify the quantity, the combinations, and the customizations of all my favorites (in stock and out of stock) by clicking on the pencil icon.\nWhen I click on the pencil icon, I am redirected to the product page to make my modifications. Once the changes are made, I just need to click on the heart icon to add this new product as a favorite. The new quantity, combination and/or customization overwrites the original favorite in the list.\nI can permanently remove a favorite product from the list by clicking on remove and a pop-up appears confirming that the product has been removed from the list.\nProducts with several options:\n If I delete my product from a product page, the product with combinations X and quantity Y will be removed. If I delete my product from a listing page (where there are no combination options), it removes only the product with the default combination - if it ever was added. If I have added any combination that is not the default one, then the product block in the listing does not display the full heart icon. It is full only if I have added the product with its default combination.  Example: I did not add the product with the default combination to my favorites list\nFor instance, I have a tee-shirt in the following combinations:\n Red (default combination) Black White  I add the black and the white combinations to my favorites. Both products cannot be removed from the listing page since the heart icon is empty.\nUS 4: Add a favorite product to the cart As a logged-in user, I can add a favorite product to the shopping cart Specific case:\n customized products cannot be added directly to the cart from the list of favorite products  Functional rules: A logged-in user can add one of their favorites to the cart (except customized products) if the product is in stock or out of stock but with the allow order option checked), by clicking on Add to cart.\nIf the product is out of stock with the option \u0026ldquo;Deny order\u0026rdquo; and therefore cannot be added to the cart:\n a message is displayed informing the user that the product is no longer available: \u0026ldquo;Product out of stock\u0026rdquo;. the \u0026ldquo;Add to cart\u0026rdquo; CTA is disabled and the product cannot be added to the cart  If the \u0026ldquo;order out of stock products\u0026rdquo; option is denied and if the selected combination is out of stock and if there are other available combinations (in stock or out of stock with allowed order) for the same product:\n a message tells the user that the product is available in other options \u0026ldquo;Product available with different options\u0026rdquo; the product image and the Add to cart CTA are disabled  For a customized product :\n If the customization is required and as the customization is always not defined (since it is impossible to save the customization as a wishlist), the user will not be able to add this product to the cart directly from the favorites list. The \u0026ldquo;Add to cart\u0026rdquo; CTA is replaced by \u0026ldquo;Customize\u0026rdquo;. When clicking on the CTA, the user is redirected to the product sheet in order to customize the product, and if it is already filled in, they can add this product to the cart. If the customization is not required, the product can be added to the cart directly.   Only non-customized products, with stock or out of stock with allow order option, can be added to the cart. If the product is out of stock and if the \u0026ldquo;order out of stock products\u0026rdquo; option is denied, the user will not be able to add it to the shopping cart, as it is currently the case in the PrestaShop Core.\nSpecific case: Let\u0026rsquo;s say the \u0026ldquo;order out of stock products\u0026rdquo; option is denied and there are 2 products left in stock. I add 2 products as my favorites and continue shopping. Meanwhile, the 2 products are ordered by another customer.\nStock for those 2 products is now 0 but I stayed on my favorite page and did not refresh the page, so the add to cart button is still enabled.\nIf I click the add to cart button, the 2 products are added to the cart but when I go on the cart details page, an error message is displayed, \u0026ldquo;The product is no longer available in this quantity.\u0026rdquo;.\nFeature 2: Storing favorites - Create and manage your favorites lists US 5: Create a list As a logged-in user, I can create a favorites list in the \u0026ldquo;Wishlists\u0026rdquo; area in My Account by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Create Favorites List\u0026rdquo; Functional rules: Who can benefit from this feature?
