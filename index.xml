      <description>Specifications for Date of delivery module In 1.7, the dateofdelivery module has never been integrated with Classic Theme, which results in the module not being displayed in front-office (when using the $hookDisplayBeforeCarrier). This specification aims at redefining available features with this module so that it is easier to make it work on PrestaShop 1.7.
FRONT-OFFICE This module displays an approximate date of delivery during the checkout process. It should be displayed in the &amp;ldquo;Shipping&amp;rdquo; section of the process, as shown on the mock up below.</description>

This document aims at explaining in details how product and order prices should be calculated in every shop scenarios.
This is a legal requirement, especially as it has an impact on invoices, so we must ensure prices are correctly calculated on PrestaShop websites.

To ensure this change did not impact developers&#39; modules, we have also let the possibility to override the image used as cover. The following specs aim at detailing what are the different behaviours, in back-office and front office listings and product pages.</description>

      <description>SPECIFICATIONS - ADVANCED PARAMETERS &amp;gt; DATABASE &amp;gt; SQL MANAGER The SQL manager is a complex feature, which should be reserved for technical people who know how to explore a database using the SQL language. In return for this complexity, it can be extremely powerful and proves immensely useful to those who master it.
1.7.8.x version The page is going to be migrated into a module. The type of module is still to be defined, the most likely solution seems to be a not installed module.</description>

      <description>symfony-migration SYMFONY MIGRATION GUIDELINES
For UX, some guidelines have been defined for each most types of page in the back-office : table and grid pages, configuration pages, drag &amp;amp; drop, etc. These redesigns are made gradually as the development skills and migration progress. This is why no design has been specified for CRUD (with create - read - update - delete actions) pages.
Please note that many pages in the BO have very specific behaviour and need their own redesign.</description>

      <description>Tags listing The tagging feature allows associating products with keywords. Customers can use the keywords to easily and quickly find the products they are looking for through the search bar in front office.
Multistore While creating or editing a tag, it&amp;rsquo;s added or edited for all shops (no matter the context selected). So, the list displays all the tags, no matter the context selected.
